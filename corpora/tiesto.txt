παμε ρε τιεστο !!!!!
Listening till now 2021 jun 30
idk why but this track feels like a train thats not stopping
Even though I was probably not even alive yet if this is set during his 90’s time. I still get these weird atmospheric feelings/vibes from his live sets
I understand exactly what you mean, as I was also born before this era in 2003 If your interested, here is the live set in which this video featured in. Amazing rollercoaster of a set https://youtu.be/rcHZUNPpqE8

tiesto shouldn&#39;t have changed his dealer. Those times were epic.
2021 and still epic
This is unbelieveble that this is in top 2500 all time on 2500th position so it gonna be kicked out soon cause zitti e buoni isnt in top 2500 right now so this is the last days this is in 2500🥺

Bring back the old tiesto pleaseeeee
Yeah bring back the time because he actually forgot the part of shutting down the real lethal industry & save the world ✌
спиздил у МС пох бит
my number 1 of all music electronic...
Estos eran los mejores tiempos del trance canciones como lethal industry, elements of life, eternity, etc. Son mejores que las que actualmente produce DJ Tiësto.
Asi es, tiesto fue uno de los mejores del trance en aquellos tiempos!
Esto si es electronica a la mierda el pinche house que solo busca dinero
I entered to this world of Electronic music since 2014 and Tiesto has been my favorite DJ since then. I got very impressed when I knew he produced Trance music before (which was amour a month ago) <br>PD: I love you +Tiesto
+nym5qu17 I don't know why the notification of your comment never got to me, but nowadays I'm pretty into electronic music but thanks lol
good choice
+Dannia Villegas darude, deadmau5, daft punk, kraftwerk are some of the best the electronic genres have to offer
+Young Killa woohoo fellow trance lover
About*
Con ésta me enamoré de Tiësto
@***** en español plis
@***** para k kieres saber eso jaja saludos
@***** NO, y losabes...PS:esta de moda esconderse detras de esa frase "ez solo sarcazmo""
@***** NO, eso NO. Es lo mas posser que eh oido
+CARLOS ASCENCIO to tambien y con Traffic , él deberia de hacerle un edit a esta, pero que no la cague
Back when he was an actual young chap but yet still soo matured...where have you gone Tijs...
Alec Empire- SuEcide cover
Trance trance trance  :) love this one.
Cuando se mezclaba en el set... No tenias un pendrive donde guardar el show entero.
+D.A Mxrtini. Men, Esos tipos de DJ siempre mezclan en el set... Por eso siempre seran profesionales.
Still rememeber whem when this video was released, still don&#39;t know the mixer&#39;s model :/
Trance ♥
si q regrese al trance, el giro q tomo d plano no es Dj Tiesto, es solo publicidad.Vuelve Tiesto haces falta en la escena electronica
Si tienes razón extraño a ese tiesto de antes
Lethal Industry.........How accurately and tragically....
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgz2SWdKqvQ&amp;t=2m45s">2:45</a> Booooooo!!!!!! lol

ΤΡΕΛΑΑΑΑΑΑ ΕΛΛΑΔΑΑΑ ΑΜΟΡΓΟΣΣΣΣ
da pazzi sei un grande cazzooo
The big Tiesto before and now: c
ohh tiesto why did you stop making trance music?? i miss the old tiesto soooo much!! :&#39;/ :x
From what I've read he didn't really produce his own work anyway. Other people did, he just took the credit for it.
YES :,)
vamos a poner Las cosas en claro1 yo mando 2 yo mando 3 a mi me Mandan a set yo quedo claro
Song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgz2SWdKqvQ&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> ???

Lethal Industry..
gerçek tieosto 2006&#39;lı yılların sonunda bir uçak kazasında öldü sanırım. yerine geçen herifin yaptıklarıyla bunun hiç alakası yok.  açıkcası şuanki tiesto&#39;nun &#39;&#39;yossi kohen&#39;&#39; olduğunu düşünüyorum :)&#39;&#39;tiesto come back to trance&#39;&#39; diyerek bitiriyorum.
Dj tieso el mejor jajajaha tiesto great
El mejor del mundo!
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
TIESTO CUANDO VENDRAS A ECUADOR ! 
Clásico de toda la vida!!
THIS is still giving me shivers/goosebumps ! Real power of true trance ! 
Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgz2SWdKqvQ&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> has to be one of the sickest moments in dance music history. Fuck me with your music mr.T !!!!!!!!!
LEGENDARY
Amazing <b>-</b>
@Tiësto...This is just amazing! Why Tiësto?! Why did you not continue making this masterpieces?! it&#39;s true, it&#39;s true, it&#39;s true, it&#39;s true of x 1000 it&#39;s true... WHY????
&lt;3 Back at a New Era &lt;3
Asta era pe vremea cand oamenii iubeau sunetele. Cand oamenii nu se speriau de sunete. De la un bpm de 130-140, am ajuns la un bpm de 110-120. Oare ce urmeaza?
This is a classic!
Its was always you.
GAME OVER<br>Tiesto is in da Hoooouse!!!
Tiesto the best
WOOOOOO CAJUUUUU
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgz2SWdKqvQ&amp;t=01m28s">01:28</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgz2SWdKqvQ&amp;t=01m38s">01:38</a> peoples in a trance?
Tiesto only dj that his sounds still fired besides are olds
Hearthstone song?<br>Lethal Kappa
Perfect performance
Came to watch this after watching Wasted, sorry needed some real Tiesto
CLA-SI-CA-ZO!!!  
Tiesto fue...<br>no es...
Tiesto is KING music TECHNO
Don't, Tiesto never produces techno, he produced House and Trance only
uff  tiesto number 1  WORDL. 
it&#39;s so year 2000 but i still love it!
Old School &lt;3 
Masterpiece. 
@Alan Corns Lethal Industry was released in 2001, whereas the VSTi plugin you mention was released fourteen years later in 2015. You may or may not be able to recreate a similar sound in Noizefield 4, but Tiesto definitely did not use it to make Lethal Industry. Furthermore, VSTs are not analogue, nor are most hardware synths from that era, I don't think you understand the term.
So analogue and so sweet.! the original VST plugin he actually used to make this track. " Noisefield 4.tune 1. " So now you know what vst plug he used.
Oh! Japanese T-shirts!ヨハン!!<br><br>I am Japanese
YU Gi Oh(遊戯王） ←NO
Yes　Japanese T-shirts! YO HA N
LOL! *Yu-Gi-Oh!*?
For me hes the best dj alive

After the release of "In My Memory, album" a little bit later he dropped the label "DJ"  but still after that he released 2 trance albums "Just Be" and "Elements of Life" as Tiesto, and the last trance album as Allure in 2011, but really miss those years 1998,1999,2000,2001 old times....

Best single-chord song ever, I dare you! The pulsating rhythm is addictive, I need an eargasm
Yeah old good trance stuff!

tiesto rocked, now tiesto sucks really hard, makes you wonder if he was the creator of this

Classic Tiesto before he got the Cheese bug and went all Cheesey - damn shame
The Richard Durand remix of this is bliss!!
Casi 2020 y siempre increíble Fly 643 💥

Nice Boeing 747
Lo mejorrrr
Flight 643 very nice song
Messssyyy tune
Класс рахмет
Музыка спасибо от души
It amazes me just how little the electronic/techno music has progressed since Tiesto. In this song you hear so many of the elements that are still being played at techno festivals.. Tiesto was a legend, after him there is a huge gap and then come the rest. Tiesto was disruptor
FIFA 2002, buenos recuerdos.

No. Its 90's.
PATO TLS 2019!!!!!
2018 and still the best legal drug
Used to really diss Tiesto back in the early 2000s because I thought Trance was cheesy (was a schranz guy, I know I know)... but looking back tracks like these are so straight to the point club bangers that make nowadays &#39;EDM&#39; nonsense look so so superfluous
😎
es kuuuul esa electronica me fasinaaa
Still in 2018
This track makes me wetter than an otters pocket.

Good afternoon passengers. This is your captain speaking. First I&#39;d like to welcome everyone on Flight 643. We are currently cruising at an airspeed of 137 beats per minute. The time is 0.00, we are expecting to land in 8.53. Until then, sit back, relax and enjoy the rest of the flight.
Ive been waiting a long time for u to pick me up glasgow airport terminal 3. ILL STILL BE WAITING LOL
love it
Amazing
Dude, You won with this comment 🙌🏼❤️
@steven reed 😄😄😄

@john byrne   relax he made a great a comment stop being so racist you fool
Captain Akmal ... 😂😂
We have a full tank of kerosene. It would appear that we have missed our slot at JFK. So we will be on a go around. Directed by the CIA.
CockatooDude I’m not getting on that flight! Did you see the pilots name👆🤨....
@Nick Lemon What the hell dude, calm down.

Tiesto vuelve al trance!!! ❤
GOLDEN ERA
Old school Classic
First heard this tune in Fifa 2002 when I was 14. Loved it then, love it now! Great tune. Dance music is awful nowadays, was awesome back then
The plane was somewhere out in the Nevada desert.<br><br>The place where we had left the mescaline on board.<br><br>There would likely be something left...
2001, a warehouse, a dj booth made out of plywood, 2 technics turntables, huge speakers, and lasers. No hands up in the air flight mode , no fist pumping, no pressing sync on your controller. Brilliant
Am stuck.. <br>In time, and it feels good
fifa 2002 :)
OMG im crying, cause miss old classic beatiful trance

Suburban Train really shows the thing, his best track was co-written, these were the times when he sourounded himself with trance artists not dance craftsmen
Don't forget, Love Comes Again :)
Krokussify yeah 💪
He sold out to the recording labels. He’s nothing but an illuminati puppet. But oh well man he gave us some amazing memories. Nothing can be perfect forever. Except god.
I see what you did there!

I have beinty cinco años escuchando my DJ in pese desde Nene in Cali Colombia in after party I. I have three ten year living in USA listed my evolution
Well, I love old Tiesto and actual Tiesto, so for me there&#39;s no sadness.
The track that inspired the numeric figure of my YouTube account name!
After 15 years, I discovered that this song and realised it was produced by Tiesto. Give me a minute guys, I need to sit
@Storm Odea llegué acá por un set de Tham 😊
Haha me as well. Just heard it on Tictok and was shocked who it's by. Sounds like a Techno banger.
@TheCoolestGuy We all learn everyday!
I can understand. For around 5 to 6 years, I thought Tiesto was always a house producer until I came across these.
@Matas Navi Actually I heard this song when I was in the 2nd grade in FIFA 2002. Subconsciously loved it but never got around to know more about the song/ artist. Here we are now :3
Latało się przy tym 3 metry nad parkietem... &lt;3 :)

The good old days when Trance music was the bommm! Nowadays its crapp!!!
The best trance of Armin
Either he sold himself out or mainstream ran him into the ground. He has played trance music again at some festivals in recent years
Well...when Tiesto was good yeah
Trance is bangin even more now than it ever was.. And top class acts coming out of my country 🙌🏼 Bryan Kearney, John O Callaghan, Paul Denton, Shugz, Shneijder, ☘️
hope i cpuld go back in time and listen to him live.....pure trance
the best trance music ever!!!
Tiesto did 4 or 5 really great tracks .. this is one of them ..<br>(now he is not so good ...  !! lol )
That&#39;s a Boeing 747
Jup. Flight 643 is a flight on a 747-400 Queen of the Skies. It was back then and still is now.
@José Ospina If it isn't a Boeing, then I am not going :)
Brian Landa when tiesto made this great music it is 643 😂😂😂
When i first hear this song again after 11 years in 2014 i plug in 480 watt speakers and dance like the devil atleast 30 min.
Helo 2016 !
want the old tiesto back!!!!
fifa 2002 xdd
2016.
Fifa 2016, and still listening to it in 2002
One of my favorite Tiesto tracks of all time! ! 👍😎
advance mind for music
EA Sports Fifa 2002
Is that really Tiesto? Fuck... I thought he always made shitty music. But this stuff is danceable as fuck.
@Merlin Erdogmus look up Kamaya Painters, it's an alias of him and some great tracks
@Marco C I'll give his discography a try. Thanks for letting me know dude.
@Merlin Erdogmus his album, Just Be, was his last good album in my opinion. And by Gouryella I mean his productions under Gouryella with Ferry and under his Tiesto and many more alias' were equally as good up to and including the Just Be album.
@Marco C https://www.discogs.com/artist/4107-Gouryella You mean the stuff from 1998 - 2017 was good and everything else bad? Didn't find any releases under "Just Be".
From gouryella to just be. Downhill from there.
@Mahmoud Elzomor I don't enjoy live ever, period, doesn't matter which artist it is.
Try this life its different than any other show
@Mahmoud Elzomor Sorry, I don't enjoy live performances.
Try Tiesto Copenhagen live concert 2008 elements of life its 4 hours concert ... and try in search of sun rise 4 5 6 7 they are unbelievable and 1 2 3 are pretty good
@Neptuno San I don't enjoy live gigs and recordings of such in general.
Just watch Tiesto In Concert 2003
was a god :) take it from me he was my idol :) I don't recognize him anymore :)
wtf are u sayng? TIESTO IS GOD MAN..
liseliler bilmez
@D.J. Heaven I see. Thanks anyway.
I gave you the most so part, its copy paste after that:) nothing is free of effort :D Yes, on mixcloud
@D.J. Heaven Can you give me normal links? We can use normal links since 3 or 4 years or so. I know, I know. I just prefer the Sam Barb version. But personal taste and that shit. Do you also have DJ sets on Mixcloud or somethin'?
+Merlin Erdogmus (SYLVER SECOND) Here you go :) Traffic: /watch?v=wXTgtFnY0Lw Suburban Train: /watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8 Adagio for Strings: /watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4 Nyana: /watch?v=zbe3xsL5uNw Forever Today: /watch?v=MtJju8htq0A Euphoria: /watch?v=A7y6JpMt_Ro Olympic Flame: /watch?v=armga4n5jYw Love Comes Again: /watch?v=vrOsBUznzSY Just Be: /watch?v=PKyiBqmGNN8 Adagio for String is a piece of music written by Samuel Barber which is the only "original" this one is Tiesto's interpretation :)
@D.J. Heaven A) Can you gimme some links? Kinda lazy but still interested. B) I DEFINITLY prefer the original Adadio For Strings.
Try Nyana, A Tear in Open, Forever Today, Traffic, Euphoria, Suburban Train, Lethal Industry, Olympic Flame and Adagio for Strings. With Vocals Love Comes Again, Everything, Just Be
you have to check all his old tracks 😉
metam cocain marihuana ecstasy
It&#39;s a shame that the tiesto fans of today have no understanding of why us original fans love tracks like this so much. I&#39;m glad I seen him live a few times before he changed. This is the tiesto I know and will always love!
@Jeroen Hoff It is not development, it is just being a commercial trash.
@jonathan van havere It is correct.... Easy chessy little EDM snowflakes.
same here mate. I saw him live three times before he changed...
So am I mate seen him in his prime quite a few times still a legend wish he would come back to Ireland when this Corona crisis is over and done with.
Not Disclosed I’m 16 and love this
@TheMantuxas64 You're*
Even though he didn't make one of his own tracks. Im friends with his ghost writer on Facebook
LIKWID Never Spoken Better, Thank You😉
@jonathan van havere LMAO
@David Zierold I have to call bullshit on what you are saying, the Dj was a genius. And yes he has changed playing all this cheesy EDM shite lately, that he himself has admitted gets ghost produced. Even though he was in Gouryella with Ferry Corsten they both wrote the tracks, same as when he was in Kamaya Painters with Benno De Goeij.
@Mark Weldon he never was something like a genius... and he never changed simply coz he never did one note by his own...
Back when i seen him on his element of life tour and in search of sunrise tour early 00's nobody could touch Tiesto, he was a genius 👌 sad now how he has changed 😔
@jonathan van havere the old Tiesto fans aren't trance fans too... He never made one tune himself... he always was a ghost produced brand... And after all he is a mid class DJ...
Word!
he will change many times again. just as any artist? they also devolop... audiences want them to stay put...
LIKWID 1 of the best tracks of his early days, absolutely awesome 👌
Unfortunately im too young to have ever gone to any of his concerts before he commercialised, but I seen him in Belfast in 2013 and he played all his classics with all his newer stuff, I'll never forget the cheer from the crowd the second Adagio for strings came on, hair raising! There are videos on youtube for those interested, just search Greater than belfast adagio for strings :)
TheMantuxas64 Oh the irony..
lucky you :(
TheMantuxas64 Haha they're somewhere around! I'm going to almost every trance party in The Netherlands. And appreciate the classics the most!
Bart Egbers that's because it's awful today. I'm 28 and I luckily enough was 12-14 when this all came out and I still love it. Back when it was awesome
your wrong
I wish i experienced tiesto back then.. Totally agree with you. His classics are golden. I'm 21 and into trance music. Unfortunally i'm just one of the few trance lovers of this generation.. Not many left of them these days!
The new Tiesto fans aren't trance fans but more EDM shit motherfuckers.. (i guess) ;) :p
I so miss the 98-05 beats that are so rare now a days!

mobiles are such a necessity for life now a days its rlly putting us into the future, the ultimate tool i can go on how good it is, but its killing memories and emotions, everythings gotta be filtered through it simply because ppl are not the best at using it, every time im talking someone they gotta pull up their phone every split second, i guess its good in a way...says something about their IQ lol

@Kermisreporter hola.... Me reporto de Colombia el dia 6bde mayo del 2021
@mussa msoma hello from the Netherlands. How is your country 2021 doing?
Hello from 2021
Welcome to 2020 where it is still played on the radio in Holland :)
+Xero Caliber This one is still at my top-list. Just to amazing.
Yah
Congratulation from mexico , verygood single
Trance is such a boring genre
ok. go continue with your life kid.
+Erik .PMusic Trance around 2000 was actually its most commercial period, it was the big room of that time and at the time it definitely revolved around overused supersaws lol.
I get epic feels from listening to trance. Brings back good memories from when I was younger and would always have fun with my old friends. Ahh those were the days. You must be one of those mainstream Edm pop dubstep kids. This that you're hearing right now was called dance music before it became known as Edm. There's no drop in trance. It's called the climax.
you must be a dubstep kid
fucking 12 y.o only want to listen shitty big room go to hell
+Erik .PMusic  I am 18 and can only dream of going back in time and hearing this eargasmic music live.
+Bernard Berari I believe it's boring for today's teenagers who have no taste of music or knowledge about what real electronic music is. Today's cheesy pop EDM has no soul like trance or old school techno or house does. Trance music is not about eardrum-bursting big room drops or overused supersaw chords like today's EDM, which i bet is the "not boring genre" for you For me, trance music is something that transcends me into another locations and awakes emotions and memories. Trance is music that is made with real talent and feeling. There is no need for a heavy drop if the melody makes you get shivers all over. If you think trance is boring, you fail as a listener.
+Bernard Berari u are boring
@***** Interesting... I think that'swhy Tiesto is still producing Trance :/
@Mohammad Alshanabla I saw some comments on other Tiesto vids about this song, so i checked it out. 
@Bernard Berari And you came here because...?
The King Of Trance... Amazing!
Bende bu adama hasta 👍👍👍
this is REAL tiesto...now tiesto sucks
@priit tarr they were made by ya mammy
you got that right 10000000%
@priit tarr the guy wrote the prison break music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDJTB45IEJs
@priit tarr they are certainly not. they are created however in a very small studio, somewhere in the south of holland, and not in breda
i think all tiesto tracks are made by: ferry corsten.
@Teodorescu Mihai in our countrey he stil is
Tiësto rules forever
You sucks
lol+
<br>
Wonderfull
still amazing
back when trance was real
Try this on ecstasy... LOL! Tiesto &lt;3

man this song makes me want to have sex
Flight sex for free
When year this was released?
2001
In the 1990 Some were i think
Is this about Turkish Airlines Flight 634, that crashed in Istanbul 2003?! Hope not, strange to make a song about it.
Air India knows music 
GBH Great British Helicopters it still is running. I flew KL643 and KL644 end of july. I flew a boeing 747-400 combi (on upper deck). When it was famous it used a 747-400 as well. It still uses a 747-400 most of the time. If not a 747 they use a airbus.
Something tells me that KL643 returning as KL644 still operates between Amsterdam Schiphol and New York JFK. Will have a careful look at Flight Radar 24 though these days it will be one of the Boeing 777-300ER or Boeing 787-9 aircraft assigned to it. When this was famous it was operated using an MD-11.
😱
Zoutvat jup. And I’m flying it this year.
:)
Oh, cheers! I've occasionally and casually wondered. A little less chaos in my life now.
Flight 643 wasn't Air India, No idea why it is the picture here. Flight 643 was a non-stop flight between Amsterdam and JFK New York carried out by Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM for short). And Tiesto was dutch and had been using this flight route alot.....
I don&#39;t like this track, but still better than his new music...
I love all his songs.
Extraño a este Tiesto :/
Imádom ennyi idő után is
Fifa 2002 
FIFA 2002 &lt;333 best game ever!
I agree in 100%
Love this track! 👍 
we miss you tiesto,when you produced Trance.
And still it's a fact that he never produced one track... He always was ghost produced...
this. love u.
The best trance of Armin
TIESTO AVB PVD were awesome, now they are shit :(
bariss temur The alternative here is Armin van Buuren.

Back in the days before tiesto sold out

Why Air India lol?
goa
I like it how the image is &quot;Air India&quot; flight! Love Tiesto&#39;s old classic tracks! 
It's a joke from the Simpsons haha
@graham cray why did you put quotes? Any way, so you treat us (Indians) like cattle, you mean? If so, what do you want me to do?
@graham cray Cattle are treated way better in India than passengers in Air India flights
we treat you like cattle
when tiesto was good....
Trance is edm...
@***** 45 is old? His music is not bad the music taste does change overtime.
his songs are nowhere near as good, to mainstream usa edm bullshit im afraid 
This track is insanely good. It was from the times when Tiesto made real trance, not some pop inspired shit..
👍
this is some good shit, thanks heady
plz help me old Trance friends!!  I`m  searching for an old Trance track, all I can remember was a voice in the track that was saying something like:  &quot;The Airbus ......  in the sky..... in the sky... &quot;  that is all I know,  my old ipod listed the song as &quot;Dj-Jurgen&quot;  but that could wrong, as I cannot find that particular track from Dj-Jurgen... any help plz ? 
@layboyuk Thank you to ;) that was a nice tune, and the voice in side the track was almost like the one I`m searching for.. But the exact word that was in the track i`m searching for was  " Airbus.. in the sky...."    but thanx again :)
Try Airwave - Above the Sky (Original Mix)
@TeddyRumpkin  Thank you, but that is not the one. In my song there is a Male Voice talking about the Airbus..  that is not in darude ;)
 darude - sandstorm   is what you are looking for.
When I hear this track I recall Fifa 02` :)
Damn i miss fifa 02 😂😂
When I recall this track I was in a crowd of 5000 pulling mental shapes back in the early 2000's. Tried playing FIFA when I got home that night. Still trying to finish the game to be fair. Motherwell vs Israel if anybody's interested.
i want this shit back the music from now is way to.mucj electronic
anyone using the term EDM does not know real electronic music
Agree. As a general term I use "Electronica" not "EDM". People tend to get really confused when they they say they listen to EDM and I ask what genre? House? Trance? What type of house and trance? Hard House? Progressive Trance? There are, or used to be, very distinct differences in the styles of each genre. Now people just don't know.
o rly
CORRECT!!!!!!
Im never tired of this one
Agreed
The word EDM didn't exist before 2010. It's American pop culture and has absolutely nothing to do with real genres like House, Trance, Techno, Downtempo Breakbeat etc. Stop calling it EDM you brainwashed Americans that probably listen to Justin Bieber, Shawn Mendes, Ariana Grande. 2020 will be the death of EDM and the revival of the genres. Fuck the generic pop music culture. The genres will come back!
da fuck is EDM????
EDM is a taste of shit.
That was really trance, now too much electronic it mean composed by computer, Old vinyl have another compilation more acoustic, more air.
+Jarrod Poulter if you can't differ between big room and acid house, then go listen to whatever genre you can actually distinguish. We don't need people who treat electronic music as some cheap one-dimensional sounds that require no talent in here.
+Jarrod Poulter Lmao I don't hear Americans say "I listen to rock", because there are SO MANY subgenres to rock right? Same thing goes with electronic music, EDM was widely accepted after Avicii's commercial track "Levels" (in 2011) that promoted and encouraged half assed pop electronica to be made (although some were pretty good, but THE MAJORITY were for commercial purposes, NOT for emotional or spiritual understanding). "EDM" is a term made by those who perceived electronic music into the mainstream pop culture of the Western society, almost any tracks before "EDM" weren't really over-hyped popular cross continents.
The term EDM is used most in 2012-2013 about the rise of bigroom. That mean EDM is nowaday mainsteam music. Trance can stay out from this
+K!ck I hate when people throws all subgenres in a big pot... they just don't know how to cook them!
+Antonio R I think it's more laziness than lack of knowledge, if someone asks me what music I like, I tell them Trance and House, I would never refer to them as EDM, although when I used to listen to pop/dance in the early 2000's I used to just call that Dance music
@Tha Tls if you were born in the 80's
+Antonio R It's better than every one calling electronic music just techno.
How so?
@K!ck It's a good term to use when people ask about your music taste, instead of listing off about 14 different sub-genres. But I see where you're coming from, like the 12 year olds listening to skrillex with their fisherman hats and weed clothing
@Jarrod Poulter it's not about the term it's about the ppl who use it. This term throws all subgenres in one big pot, ignoring the tons of differences. THAT'S why ppl who use it don't know about electronic music.
@Antonio R EDM is a term used for any percussive electronic music, this is possibly the dumbest comment I've read in my life. It's even more shocking that 41 people agree with you...
@Antonio R You said it bro!!

@Snallis thanks
@Don Juan abbrevation of ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC
wtf is EDM?
@Masterfootballer23 Ah....Trouse. How I dislike thee. 
What do you mean? I've been using the term EDM to describe my taste since way before Trouse was invented.
For sure
We are just a little bit better then anyone else, arn't we?
linie melodica perfecta, super energica , de inalta clasa,,,,n-are cum sa nu-ti placa asa ceva daca ai sange in tine ;) 
Piola piola heres mi favorito tiesto heres el mejor carajo pero algun dia te superare....:-P
This is NOT TIESTO !!!!!!!!!!! 
Ah! This reminds me the period when Techno started to take elements over from Trance thus creating a new sub/fusion genre - Tech Trance. True, purest of Trance it isn't just like what you called it, but I don't think anyone will release any more of theese gems any time soon.
@Hugo Hakvoort This is considered industrial trance, yet it can still be considered "pure" trance. Depends on if you're using that phrase to define a genre or to differentiate from the mainstage EDM that is being labeled as "trance".
@Woz Not Woz This isn't pure trance, pure trance is hypnotic and doesn't focus on the climax and break. Early 90s stuff is pure trance, nowadays JOOF Records stuff or psytrance (No not the proggy commercial stuff from Coming Soon or Interactive Noise, but stuff like Hypnocoustics or Soul Kontakt).
@Glider4 set your way back machine for 1998-2004.
@Woz Not Woz where can I find more like this?
I'm sorry to tell u pablo, but this is the pure trance from 2002 , not the piece of EDM shit 2014 ^^
Idiot, yes it is. It's tiesto with flight 643 -.-
.....Yes it is.
fifa 02!
Feel It!!! &lt;3
Infected mushroom dont see Tiesto from one meter.
it depends, in the old days they were both good in their field.Now days Tiesto produces crap, and Infected are still amazing.

FIFA 2002 EXCELENTE !!
Perfect preflight tune!
Still Goose bumps all over again !!! Retro !!! Gosh i remember good all days, !!!
Trance is dead since tiesto left :(
@felipe trance Well i listen to them ... but only Tiesto's old trance could really ... "speak" to me . And some of armin and photographer tracks
you got to be kidding right? maybe the comercial trance is dead and i'm so glad for that,.But the real trance is still alive!!! please listen dj like : aly & fila, John askew, bryan kearney,indecent noise,sebastian brandt and many more, they are the real face of trance music. Trance 4 lifeeeee ;)
Armin is heree! trance never die.. and i hope tiesto back :(

This is when Tiesto was good
i also consider this trance greater than nowdays edm , but that's not a reason for not understading how special tijs still is
Markus Schulz pisses all over Tiesto these days. Tiesto sold his soul to the devil.
Tiesto was never good . Tiesto always was Legend and he is still the best
Adamın Dibisin Tiesto Reis
This tune must be example for the nowadays trance producers and Dj&#39;s.
LOL, alright Yelah. I knew that, but I wouln t like to eat one or even to give it a try. Sorry :D. But I didn t know that Wikipedia was even reffering to the track title of the flight 643 ;)
hollabd is better hardwell is number 1 
never mind ;) We still are the best in music my friend Martiman..
Apparently you missed Belgium&#39;s 90&#39;s club scene… I feel sorry for you :p
lolol
You have to be a troll?
U people are crazy!
ORIGINAL 1 - 0 rmx 2013
Should def be KLM
The best part is when it go&#39;s Wild : BZZt BZZ BZ BZ BZZ bZZt
lol put some respeckt on this comment
Favourite song to hear while flying
the best DJ&#39;s are from HOLLAND.!!! 
Stop your racism here..
okay I didn&#39;t know that, just looked it up on wiki and your are right.. questions are never stupid btw.. we learn from each other.. For example, did you know they are eating guinea pigs in Peru? I have some delicious recipes for you if you want...
Cause the trackname is Flight 643!!! and not Flight107!! What a stupid question Sry.
Why KLM if Qantas is the safest airline in the world...
5.40 candır amk :D
banging tune 
Not correct ... 643 stands for sex-for-free 
Air INDIAA. :3
by far d best.... 
 T U R K E Y 
fifa 2002 (Y)
Sit on the klm picture and fly away :D
then sit on the flight and flew away
Flight 643 stands for the flight number of KLM&#39;s flight from Amsterdam to New York ;)
Ibiza toch
This is real damn trance. Just like Lethal Industry &amp; Traffic.
I like all of him
Brilliant Trance
Pure Trance!
this is the purest trance. trance dont need to have uplifting notes all the time
FIFA 2002 was and is the best football I&#39;ve ever played :)
Prfff, then, you played nothing
@Risto Kappet omfg that's epic
@Kuba YES
@Risto Kappet why he wrote about here ? Was that a soundtrack to fifa or what ?
YES
FUCKKKKKKK!!!! WHAT A TUNE!!!
mosquitoes love this trance
:D
HAHAHHAHHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAHAH 
haha this is not house, its tech trance. 
Yeah the good old-school trance. This is the stuff ^^
duhuhuhahaha :D 
estas eran las buenas canciones de tiesto,no la mierda de musica q hace ahora 
nice xD 
Tiesto has blow fucked up this plane by the fligh 643 !!!
This song is House - there&#39;s not much melody. It&#39;s basically about the beat and the repetitive sounds. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll like Traffic much either. Both of those are bland if you&#39;re used to listening to Trance. 
because the maker of the video is dislexic
He should stick to copying other peoples work! Tune .....less
how cool
fifa 98 :&#39;) 
When Tiesto used to do Ttance
Короче тесто, так ничего лучше чем этот трек не написал
my god is called TIЁSTO

I think I'm still peaking
The great Hit Prof😉👌🎶💯💯💯💖💖💖2021

It&#39;s crazy to think I was fucking 14 when i first heard this. I remember running around as a night elf druid moonfire tab spamming mobs jamming out to this. Shit man.
I want this song playing at my funeral, with the priest doing the decks as I&#39;m sent to the crematorium, just saying 😂
592 I mean lol
Are you 529? woah .
Tiesto just killed it<br>goose bumps

Class track, enjoy :) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=3m43s">3:43</a>
I am 2021 years old and song makes this good one lifting and running
The amount of nostalgia I get from this is immense
i&#39;m 728932 years old but this music makes me feel 94382 years younger!!
Makina FERDİ
when i die and all my life pass in front of my eyes i want this song be the soundtrack...
Too long
This gives me the tingle to want some GURNERS!!!!
even pull up bar can&#39;t handle it
2021
DJ TİESTO DİNLEMEYEN ADAM ASKER OLAMAZ!!
who&#39;s still listening to this banger in 2021?
Where am I on the internet?
When you think about it, classical and EDM require two similar things, composition. An EDM Producer composes his pieces no different than a Classical composer ever did. One single person hand picking each instrument to deliver a certain sound at a certain time. How is EDM any different then Classical when you view it like this?
Makina Ferdi&#39;ye Selam olsun ortaaaamm
aksarayda benim gibi makine yok
@Bledge öyle bir İspanya yok kardeşim

He is LEGEND!

Rewatched &quot; platoon &quot; the other day and remembered to listen this again..great remix 😁
go see my new remix of tiesto lord of trance <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odhGyltakuA&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odhGyltakuA&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
First time I&#39;ve listened to Adagio for strings was in 1986 in a film called Paltoon starring Charlie sheen, I just love it.
I just watched Platoon today and now i see your comment here :D
ART
I still listening until now since 2009
Love this song especially when I&#39;m doing any stressful work or assignment. Place my headset and turn the volume to the max. And feel the beat😎
Tiësto и Paul Oakenfold два бога среди людей, они уже всё что хотели - сказали. Люблю, слушаю, получаю мурашки, вспоминаю двухтысячные
Love it!!!
listened to it, liked it and searched up more info on it..<br>turns out, this was released on the same day I was born (down to the year)<br>this is now a special song to me
Nothing to say🔥🔥🔥🔥
Still one of the best songs ever from Tiesto.
This is favorite Track 7, the most difficult track for the Les Mills RPM indoor cycling class that I regularly attend.
2021 coviiiid
Still remember when this first dropped.
Me too buddy, me too
this goes as a banger in history, its time proof mans..
I&#39;m 102 and I really love this type of music, makes me feel 90 again.
Brilliant
@John McMullen no because dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago. 102 years ago the first world war had just ended and I was just a baby.
102? Do you miss the dinosaurs?
@Tristan T. Moss find a club with a retro night and request it. If you can't find that, create it
@Cihan Aytac aman Yarabbi Türk insan

I was literally 4 when this came out I wish I could have been older to enjoy the experience or find bops like this earlier. Sad I have to find these so late.
Lol
I am 28 and this feels like 1000s of years ago

My music taste brought me back here
My neighbours love this song so much, that they threw a brick into my window so they can hear it better.

Respect! 🔥🤛
Are you 63 by now?
Absolutely stellar outlook good Sir. Time is conceptual to us all. Take the choice to bask in an eternity of good vibes at your whim and leisure. If we choose immortality through great works that move us, we become one with it, and a part of it. We never truly leave this universe. (Apologies for verbose reply, but I have experienced a tragic needless loss recently, and your message of feeling forever young moved me. Carry on, and love what you love)

I love it when people your age still love this kind of music! My mum and dad are both younger than you and when ever this kind of music comes on at parties they're always the 1st to say "oooo I hate this boom boom music, it's just awful noise " and it makes me feel so sad that they've let themselves get old in the head! I vow to be like you when I'm your age! (I'm 38)
Your never to old when good music like this is on the net
You are still young ❤️

Good luck ♥️

I don’t care what you end up listening to .... or what genre you adopted .... if you haven’t listened to this a 100 times and still .... you don’t appreciate true electronic music ..... I don’t care how commercial he is right now .... if you haven’t got your first tiesto CD and played this while on cloud 9 .... you didn’t live life bro
Still here in 2021. Love the smell of Tiesto in the morning.

In trance we trust! and this mix is why!
I like it

Esta canción me acuerdo la escuché por 1era vez cuando fui a casa de un conocido de un amigo, estaba viendo un live video en el Ares. tipo 2005. se extrañan tantas cosas de esos años
Vamoooos vamooooos
wanna make me commit the ritual
Also on the verge of tears hearing this again...for some reason.
Remember enjoying this and many other techno/trance hits on a cd compilation many years ago.

What a pulse yea ha

Que recuerdos... nostalgia pura siento al escuchar este tema...un saludo a todos desde Madrid España 🎼🎸🎶😎
I didn´t know why I liked this song so much, then I discovered Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber. The original version, in my opinion, is better, but Tiesto made a nice work anyway.
@Tommy Wilson Indeed, Tommy.
I think it's an interesting juxtaposition. The original piece is iconic and arguably one of the most emotive pieces of music ever written. Tiesto remixed the piece into a song that people can dance to and have a good time.
Excuse me, but I don&#39;t care my age is showing 💓💖💓💖💓💖💓💖💓💖💞🧨💞🧨💞🧨🔥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥 one of my fave of all faves ever! This made my mid 20&#39;s something MORE!
If I don’t wake up half juiced and confused on Thursday did I Acc want Wednesday?
Samuel Barber thanks for the Classical Piece of your Opus. Adagio for String. 1938.<br><br>Edit: 1936 incorrect. 1938. First live stream technology. Radio.
2021 and still listen this hardtrance remix 😍😍😍😍😍😻😻😻😻😻💪<br>Thanks to william Orbit
We can easily get to know from the example of this song..that Creator don&#39;t give an ounce of Fck about his creation..no matter how beautiful His first creation was, he would still move to the next one.
Amazing classical turned into even more amazing trance
2021??

DIOS! ESTA ES UNA JOYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! ESTA CANCIÓN TE LLEVA A OTRO LUGAR, DESPERTANDO SENTIMIENTOS Y EMOCIONES DESDE LO MÁS PROFUNDO DE TU SER, SE ME ERIZA LA PIEL AL ESCUCHARLA, TE HACE MOVER EL CUERPO AUNQUE NO QUIERAS.
En su tiempo me encantaba , y ahora la escucho todavía es una joya 🖤✨🤘😜

Stilll this is best at 2021
Is this the track they play when you enter heaven
When the machine breaks down... WE BREAK DOWN.<br><br>Platoon and Sgt. Barnes for the win!<br>😏
My neighbor is rude. When I go on vacation, this song plays as loud as possible endlessly...<br>He&#39;s becoming a fan, whether he wants to or not.
This is actually kinda shit after you listen to the ferry corston version
i wonder how many crackheads had reached euphoria with this unique song.
My body&#39;s on fire, lungs are about to burst, muscles screaming in pain!!!!!!
But I like this music so I'm gonna keep going until I reach the end.
What a tune ❤️
Kawałek ma piękną melodię, kto też tak myśli to łapka w górę i koment.

@Kevin Fraser Finally someone with a brain.It's fucking alarming what's going in.
LoL. Lockdowns are forever or at least until everyone takes a dodgy vaccine that is gonna alter their dna because people in general are docile fools who swallow globalist pish.

90&#39;s trance
My first exposure to Tiësto was red lights and I&#39;ll say I like his old trance stuff more
Mine was Silence- 9 minutes of pure heaven...then this one.
Me: Adagio For Strings<br>YT: Samuel Barber?<br>Me: nope , TIESTO
Jessid Galvis yes ....Samuel Barber "Agnus Dei"
Shlamalokh
armin van Buren used to be good now hes too cheesy. Stuff is pisss now
Nice comment, but how is this related to the song? The fact that both Tiësto and Armin are Dutch?
Dobra

Kevin and Perry fans where u at
Breath taking... So Georgeous... One of the most beautifull songs ever...
I am 73 years of age, have lived my life alone in high country or in deserts across the earth and know beyond any doubt that this is music of the utmost wonder. Beauty and madness harmonised. Listen. This is genius in its most perfect form.
60 years old here and feel the same. Age is just a number when it comes to Music And cars... Petrol head, 😁🎶🎼
Im 1000 yrs old, and still listening :D
@Mark Hewitt When you think about it, classical and EDM require two similar things, composition. An EDM Producer composes his pieces no different than a Classical composer ever did. One single person hand picking each instrument to deliver a certain sound at a certain time. How is EDM any different then Classical when you view it like this?
@Jared Aikins I've tried to explain this to others but no appreciation😂 every respect to other tastes. Thay alll have there flaws. Even this 😭😭😭
@Benjamin Picton😂😂😂😂😂
I love your comment 🥰
Guys just remember that this might just be a fat lie, although if it is true, then damn, We have the most OG person over here
He lives on a Bradford council estate lol only joking Geoffrey pal, I have a feeling that you will take the comment in good spirits
cool story bro <3
Classical tunes and EDM go very very well... they compliment eachother perfectly. This song will always be golden to me.
... seems like some good decisiones you have made in your life ...
@Vladimir Saraiva I have been listening to the original all my life
Wait until u listen 2 d original
wanna do some mdma with me?
Well he got it from Samuel Barber just found out listening to the real one made me think of Tiesto. So glad he kept the real name 😍😍
Geez, here I am at a mere 63, and feeling guilty about lovin' this ))))
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️
party on geoffrey :)
May I ask which countries those were?
Absolutely beautiful. Stay amazing bro

How the hell did he do that from the classic one ?
105 mln views ?!
Greatest Trance tune of all time?
@RollingCoasters 23 hard to argue. Robert Miles was probably the first trance music I listened to ever, and Children is quality. Mind it was the first tune that ever sounded anything like the real thing on the old mp2 so made an amazing ring tune lol. Is still the tune I have set as my alarm too. Wakes you up in a great mood.
I say that goes to Robert Miles - Children
Dakii
2021?
They should send this song to space. Day one # We made contact with intelligence lol
Proper Tiesto!

I advise everyone to listen to the original!
the world is ending
I just discovered that Samuel Barber was the original writer of that melody.
Barbers adagio for strings. ATB and Ferry Corsten versions from the late 90s are just as legit.
Tiesto is the fuel to the fire in my life
Tiesto u r superb....one of my best <a href="http://trance.love/">trance.love</a> from pakistan....

U search for this, and ur old.. &lt;3
Original music – Samuel Barber - Adagio for Strings.
Tiesto is god
Which are your memories during to hear this Song,I am thinking my first love, holidays and Sport👻🤛👊
I honestly feel bad for old EDM for being almost forgotten by people who are once willing to listen to music like this... Also, modern EDM have only hit-or-miss tracks that are only chasing trends these days in my opinion...
@Holmes Holmes. Yes
no matter who, once they listen to these once, and they listen again either because they found it by chance one more time or someone ask them about it, it will forever be a fonding piece of masterpiece
THESE DREAM IS A NICE TRANCE

oh the things i could tell you!!!
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=04m23s">04:23</a> this classic literally begins to fall apart under the weight of its own genius
2021.... 12 years and still powerful.
This played at my job the other day I was instantly hyped and wanted to yell TIESSTOOO!!!😝 it’s been years since I heard this tune ! meanwhile a co worker had the nerve to say “I don’t like this music” lol whatever I hummed the hell out 😝

Back when tiesto was good without any &quot;featuring&quot; in his tracks.
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I like the Barber Shop Quartet of this one, yes? Are you with me, as Tiesto is not quite feeling my pulse on this one, heart throbs nonetheless. Yay Tiesto, yay Barber Shop Quartet!!
thanks dj T
You people are dump go watch the real history behind this music the elephant man Joseph Cary mirrick

Tiesto, thank you for the memories. A Search for the sunrise tour 2009 in Malaysia, the best day in my life listening to this song live
I&#39;m making music just like Tiesto. Hope I make the big shot 🔥🔥🤟
Stop asking who’s still listening, we will always be listening to this
It’s a Terry and June!
@Life’s lessons Do you know why you see so many of those messages all over YouTube? They're from people whose accounts are at risk because they've got so many thumbs-downs, so they have to post something that they KNOW will get lots of thumbs-ups to put their accounts in good stead again. Then they can go back to what they're really on YouTube for....spamming their links.
facts
Im dancing
And another thing .... WE WOULDNT BE HERE IF WERE’NT LISTENING ....WOULD WE ! Ffs 🤦‍♀️
Agreed
I gived you 500 like xd
Actually, No....as a species we will NOT be always listening. to techno. Fads come and go. Listen to a version that depicts how it was MEANT to be played and heard. THAT will be around far far longer....

Tiesto is king🔝❤️
this song fucking proves Tiesto was a daddy for all of them ; class apart
Wow, so lovely song shared by you my friend.
Escuchar este hermoso track en EDC 2020 fue el uno de los mejores momentos que pude vivir. 😍😍😭😭 jamas lo olvidare!
Lo hubieras escuchado las veces que vino solo hacer sus eventos en: Cancún o cuando vino en la Arena Ciudad de México. Eso fue mucho antes de que fuera en el EDC 2020 y cuando todavía tocaba "Trance". Eso sí fue una joya presenciarlo. 👌
Que envidia hermano, yo no pude asistir:(
2021
6he best in history!
You absolute Philistine for remixing this beautiful piece of music. If you had any taste, understanding concept of art you wouldn’t even bother touching this piece of music.
I never imagined anything could surpass the original...this is brilliant!.... and no party drugs.. just chardonnay!.... if people need mind- altering drugs to get into this there is seriously something wrong with them!
I keep coming back
Pensaba que tiesto la avía creado 😐
2021
Everyone : &quot;Avengers Endgame is best crossover ever &quot;<br><br><br><br>Tiesto: &quot;Hold my beer&quot;
my condolences to everybody who does only know this version and not the real masterpiece adagio for strings or its choir version. This is just a pity shadow
Not really. I'm a 31-year-old band nerd that loves various music genres and I still enjoy original pieces people sample from. Others like us are out there. You gotta believe!
2021 y todavia la escucho very cool
MEMORIES ILLL NEVER EVER FORGET CANT BECAUSE MUCH MUCH MUCH
Ita very difficult to remix a classic like adagio and do a good job. <br>In an older interview, tiesto himself mentioned how difficult it was to remix. He had to get it right to do the original song justice. <br>Songs that are written in history books like the original adagio ...only the top 2-3% of DJs will dare remix it. <br>Its the kind of song that has high risk-high reward. If the DJ gets it right, then it will be a big hit. Conversely, if they get it wrong then their career will be looked at more closely with a critical eye. Thats why most DJs choose not to take on such songs.
Rap Porto Novo e a Cuca! Se escrevam no meu canal 🤜🤛

Its incredible how Tiesto managed to make such an energetic song with one of the saddest songs in classical music
Compared to William Orbit s version, it s poor....

I can call Tiesto. The prophet of DIJ in the world cause he got unique type of feelings and emotions so that’s why his DIJ various than the other DIJ player.
Nr. 2 in ASOT TOP 1000! ♥ FUCKING LEGEND, we miss you
We all know it's #1. Shivers doesn't hold a candle to this masterpiece.
this shouldve been #1!
Obviously no.1, but it's an ARMIN show, how can a song from another artist other than Armin can be no. 1. Adagio for strings sends emotions that can reach further in anyone soul, unlike shivers, wich is a great song (no one can deny that) but can't top Adagio for strings!
LEGEND
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23asottop1000">#asottop1000</a>
Here after this track made it to ASOT1000 at no2.. it was what got me into loving trance in 2006.. so thrilled.. getting goosebumps and in tears!
2021 here!!
Who&#39;s here after ASOT 1000? :)
Number 2 of asot of the history , la segunda mejor canción trance de todos los tiempos según asot.
@Isaac cruz colorado rumores no quiero. Ok . Que sea alguien cercano a tiesto o respuesta que salga de el .
@Isaac cruz colorado pero si hay alguna crítica hasmelo saber , por qué si no hay críticas de parte de tiesto , no hay nada que molestarse . Nesecito pruebas , noo opinión del público, una cosa el público , otra cosa los artistas reales ok.
@Isaac cruz colorado cierto y tiesto es mi idolo y no salió en las canciones que el estaba colaborando. Ahí si te puedo dar la razón pero pueda que no estaba presente. Y ahora que lo pienso adagio for strings es una canción tan conocida que debería estarlo , pero es por votación del público, bueno , no se , tampoco se inglés . Pero si queda así pues qué haci sea yo también respeto a Armin , tanto Armin como tiesto son los mayores exponentes . Mejor tiesto por su puesto.
@Dionet Ayala Pero hay que entender ue tiesto no mando mensaje de agradecimiento también como se veria esa acción si fuera el track más premiado
@Isaac cruz colorado como que polémica , si es un clásico no lo entiendo .
Polémica verdad :V
YES YES this is N.1 ASOT 1000

clinton, bush, barrack if you still need a education come to England
like or hate him but everyone wants to make him out to be the bad man, The first president not to start a war in over god knows how long, we all sat there with Iraq, before you judge him say sorry for that.
I prefer William Orbits version myself personally.

I had a very close friend that killed himself, and this song was his favorite song. Every time I hear this song I think of him, and every time I think of him I hear this song. Rip Nemanja aka. Nemo
<3 I have a special song by Rainbow called Since you been gone and it always remind me of my friend E who killed herself the same evening i hugged her for the last time. Hope you are doing well my friend

Recently I bought Glow In The Dark dinosaurs from my supermarket. I stuck them on my chest next to my bed. They REALLY do glow in the dark. Like listening to this track in the middle of the night(with headphones). Who musically are the Dinosaurs? Maybe Justin Bieber or perhaps Taylor Swift? Peace and Love..Weird Bill from Scotland.

Wow I actually teared up from this, so powerful
Yesterday I tried to lie down right in front of the subwoofer and surround myself with the rest of the speakers. Then I turned on this track at maximum volume and bass. It was fucking magical, the closest thing I can compare it to is a ritual. You're in another world when the soundwaves blast inside of you and reverberate thoughout your whole body. Everybody has to try that at least once. Preferrably stoned or something like this
Gratidão por contribuição de Deus em nome da arte 🙏🙏
You probably haven&#39;t noticed this, but even Youtube says (look at the video description) that the writer of this song is not Tiesto, but Samuel Barber, the real composer of the melody. Tiesto just played with it.
2021<br> en ht is nog steeds een beest van een lied!!!
Forever 2050...
12 anos que se passaram e estar a ouvir este somzão em 2021 até dá arrepios! Grande Tiesto 💙
2304 and I still remember this song
Forget the pandemic for 7.23 minutes. For those of us that used to club with Tiesto and others, hello x. For those of you stumbling across this anthem, enjoy, we were all young at some point in history. I used to frequent SunnysideUp down in Victoria Arches and then the big party in Camden Town. No drunken idiots, just friendship, love and respect...and banging tunes! Oi Oi! Rest In Peace McK x
Omg i just realised how many years ago it was since I was in the clubs listening to this wow i still get hairs on back of my neck and goosebumps on my arms listening to this today in 2021
🤣
2021 will be better than 2020

I can&#39;t put my finger on exactly why, but this piece of music speaks to me, it gives me hope, and also a sense of calm for it&#39;s duration when life is crazy.
@Aaron Kennedy That is an opinion, and I'll only respect it as such. I enjoy the classics and electronic music like this all the same. Why can't you respect that instead of looking up videos you hate, just to say you hate them?
I hate that some people don't hear it like us
Listen to the original classical piece man far better of that's what you're looking for .

Tune!!!
Allow me to elaborate:<br>I had an absolute shit day at work. So I left, got into my car, put this song on as loud as possible, opened all the windows and drove home at about 200km/h listening to this timeless piece. While driving and listening, it took me back, way back, to when things were different, when life was, uncomplicated. Btw I’m 36 now. I had loads of friends back then, lived in a big city, we partied till the sun came up, we loved Tiesto, we were poor but we didn’t care, we always seemed to manage, people were really amazing, people were inviting and unashamed to be associated with anybody, almost everybody was filled with compassion for everyone. I was 23, drove a shoddy car, didn’t have much, but my life was something wonderous. Now, people everywhere are negative, arrogant, wouldn’t give you a cent, looks down on everyone and have this enormous sense of importance about them. I moved away from that big city to a very small coastal town, here nobody shares this love for Tiesto, which is old love, loved by old souls. Here everyone seems to think all this new age non-sensical shit music is what counts, and don’t you dare try to explain the genre of those days, try to share this type of old love, it makes me really really sad to know and experience this. I am financially fairly good, but I have all this debt, I worry myself sick every month, life is so complicated, I’m on anti-depressants, I curse and get irritated so easily because people don’t care about anything but themselves, I’m alone, and life is one constant race to see who gets the most likes at the end of the day. Back then we didn’t even know what Twitter and Instagram meant, we didn’t care about social media, we cared about eachother, physically, emotionally, spiritually. This virus and everything in the last 5 years has gone and completely fucked up life. But I will never ever turn down the volume of Tiesto in my car even though I’m being snared at with utmost narcissism, because only people of back then who kept holding on to a pure and good heart, will be able to share and understand this type of sentiment.All I can do is close my eyes and dream❤️❤️❤️🔊🇿🇦🎶🎶🎵
Life is bad and evil, but it is our duty to be the best versions of ourselves. Pull through, for there will be better days when the sun will shine away the clouds
tiësto Is best

Hola
Esta canción tiene un parecido con otra pero no recuerdo cual.
I remember being 19, I had my own apartment, it had 12 foot ceilings, nothing fancy, but we would roll balls, about 15 of us and rage all weekend, we would cut up glow sticks and splash them all over the walls, fun AF.
Ya casi 2021 y está sigue siendo la mejor canción de la historia

Damn I first heard this when I was a teenager trying to build up my personality and now I&#39;m a successful man
@TechnoFeeling I'm fit, not a single bit of fat on me, I eat oats and peanut butter every morning(sometimes with banana) and do not eat chocolate and sweets/candy. I'll never get anywhere If i dont ask, I've been talking to people about crypto aswell. I'm just trying to find what I could be good at. Also, what's your twitch or socials?
@conster46660lol maybe I could give you some general advice. But the main thing is that you have to work your ass off and fix every area of your existence. -work out -meditate -eat healthy Thats the base. If you want, contact me on twitch or whatever platform you have. Maybe I can give you further advice.
@TechnoFeeling I don't suppose you could potentially teach me? I myself am struggling to find my place in this world. I can't say i know anything about poker,but if mentored in the right direction, I think I may gain higher self esteem to work on the building bricks of my life. This is of course, if you'd be interested in teaching me sir.
@conster46660lol its always worth starting because you train your brain. I had a really rough 2020 and still feel like in war. At the moment I just play from time to time and still make more money then most normal workers. If I sit on my a** and start to find a motivation again, then I can make much money.
@TechnoFeeling is it worth getting into? Like..are you scraping by or not even an issue to live, buying what you desire
@conster46660lol yes
@TechnoFeeling you're getting by in life from playing poker ?
And you have do everything right!!!!
Wholesome chain
@GuyDude439 thx
@TechnoFeeling this is inspiring
Nice man
@Liutauras B work hard. You can reach more than you think. I am 30 now and living a free life as a poker pro. Back when I was 17 I was bullied in school and wanted to kill myself. Follow your dreams but find a good balance between dreaming and being realistic. Don't drink too much alc(very bad drug), start meditation and search for self improvement channels on youtube. :)
I feel u Bro I'm going through the same shit in life I'm 17

Let the trance never ends we need more songs like this one, for me its the best song i ever heard. Who&#39;s with me?

Discordador Profissional the only trance you have here is in the intro part, after that it's pure techno
Discordador Profissional then you don't know techno...this isn't trance sorry...

I think it's more techno than trance

if you tried to remix a tiesto song you’d be soiling perfection
this song is actually a remix to Adagio for Stings - Samuel Barber. A classical song from 1936. :) Fantastic

Don’t make music like this no more absolute banger 🎧 🎶!!!
Holy shit! Usually i listen to hardcore/gabber but this track is a massive bomb! I can‘t stop listening to it

Does any track go harder
no
Ferry Corstens version went to number two in the charts UK. That’s all
господи, этот трек такой старый.... в машине на флешке живёт, я и не задумывался, когда он там появился, вот блин, класс)))
Fun fact: this song is an adaptation from the classical piece for orchestra written by Samuel Barber Adagio for strings. Look it up and you&#39;ll notice some similarities. I&#39;m not lying it&#39;s as good as the original.
This song never gets old still listening to it
Est es obra de arte que musik HP es para ponerse a llorar amo trance

This song is a masterpiece, tiesto is the Mozart of trance
Absolutely! 👍
Actually i don't think that this is trance , it's more techno than trance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAoLJ8GbA4Y
Samuel Barber – Adagio for Strings :: The compositor of this masterpiece
Except Mozart stayed in orchestral music -__-
Imagine if Mozart had access to today’s technology.. clubs would be lit Covi or not
Tiesto didn't even compose this. He just arranged and mixed a classical piece into electronic Music. Aphex twin can be called Mozart of electronic Music but Mozart was another level musical genius. He was writting Greatest symphonies and Sonatas not IDM or Techno songs.
@unhackablew00t just listened to it and I see your point lmao
FUCK YEAH 😈🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊💣💥💥💥💥💥😱😱😱💯👀👌👍

Well said!
this is classic music transfered to techno...
Oh really... i just found some similarities to this track... adagio for strings released in 2004. This is released 1998... https://youtu.be/M3o2m9mTo0g Differences but also a fair bit of similarity yes?
We all have two lives. Second one starts when we realise that we only have one.
WOW!! That hits hard man!! Love it!!

Platoon Theme song
I&#39;ve been looking for the original of this song for about 10 years. And finally found it. There were no smartphones back then. Hello from 2020. Memories come alive again. You are the king &lt;3
@BimReaper yep ^^
@FURKAN YILDIRIM Samuel Barber
Samuel abi.. :)
Resterà sempre uno dei dischi più belli....
SCAR FACE!!!!!!!!!!<br>FKN OUTSTANDING!!!<br>MEGATRON APPROVED 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
The fact that this is old is disgusting.
The memories
Doesn&#39;t get much better.
This song blasting through many big speakers in the roof in a dark room,with people, laser and flashing lights all around you, a vest on and a gun in your hand. You take cover where u can and slide into shit. Yelling and colourful lights make you feel as if you&#39;re tripping on LSD and weed at the same time. The base drops and the lights go crazy. Holy fucking shit... how did I not have an epileptic fit as a kid during lazer tag.. that shit was fucking intense
What kind of Smily&#39;s was theeeem!?<br><br>Beige. They were beige.
That is not how you spell "beige"
back when there is no facebook and no instagtam and only people dancing
@chronixxz420 MLG But he doesn't mind invading everybody elses.
even zuckerberg likes his privacy, does that not tell you something?
Or... back then there was dancing. Now, there is also dancing (and also social media, but that seems kind of irrelevant).
The world as we know it is gone. And will never come back. WE got it slowly pulled down our heads, without knowing it :(
Yes
Well, you know exactly what to do in this case. Delete them
:/
What a piece of shit.
💣💣💥💥
Back in highschool I smoked bud for the first time in my life at a friend&#39;s lan party and listened to this masterpiece high as fk, it was amazing.

Just into my 40’s and still an awesome tune without drugs.......but a couple of brown speckled mitsi’s and a few lines with this blasting full volume would take me back to a place in life that was so much easier and fun!
F the drugs

I miss these days so much, this era. I was a teen during the fist pumping guido era. This brings back so much memories, good times! If youre listening in 2020, there was nothing like experiencing this song back in the mid 2000&#39;s. Tiesto was the shit
I miss too
Tiesto is Trance Titanium
LECIMY POLSKA!!!!
Bu nə di ala BQHAHAJAHSHAUAHHSJAHS
los canis de mi barrio escuchaban esto cuando era pequeño , que recuerdos
I just simply don&#39;t understand how the people can &quot;enjoy&quot; this abomination of the original compose. It&#39;s disrespectful to Barber.
it is completely different though...
Fuck you barnes
So unfortunate my headphones has a limit....IF i go deaf, please let this be the last song i hear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Asla eski meyecek klavuz ve klasik bir şaheser
Whatever Tiesto makes I buy it as its 1st class
Brings so much joy and pleasure, filling the void, then all to soon it ends an sadness overwhelms
I wonder if David Goggins has heard this version
Sen naptın benim kafayı ya<br>Aldın nerden nereye götürdün sonra yerine bıraktın. Vay mk :/
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=1m27s">1:27</a><br>And there it is. This part is what brings back good memories. Also the part I heard in my head thank fuck past me made a playlist called &quot;Songs I will probably hear in my head randomly and will never find&quot;
I like this but Ferry Corsten&#39;s is better.
La musique nous transporte
This song gave me vietnam flashbacks (platoon for those who dont know why)

Потужна тема
Platoon
I feel something amazing everytime I listen this song
Quarantine gang where u at ?
Legend !:)
No quiero que termine nunca este tema , no puedo escuchar esto en plena pandemia donde no puedo salir a descontrolar, antes lo escuchaba de adolecente y me sigue trasmitiendo esa misma sensacion de libertad , de que estoy perdiendo el tiempo sin hacer nada, de que me da el cuero para mucho mas , de cumplir las metas, de correr y no parar , de bailar como si no me viera nadie , de tranquilidad y euforia al mismo tiempo.... me da nostalgia. son demasiadas sensaciones esto es musica, esto es lo que tiene que provocar.. tiesto sos un grande. y ahora puedo poner reiniciar las veces que quiera sin esperar nada. cuando mas lo escucho mas euforia me da. gracias. volvi años atras gracias.
Sorry muge
Si ya la encontré gracias Samuel
Muchas garcias duos te bendiga
@margarito vera Samuel Barber - Adagio for Strings
@margarito vera Es una opera si no me equivoco, asi literal se llama Adagio For Strings buscalo asi. es una opera.
Caul es el es el titulo oficial de esta pista porfavor dime... te estaré agradecido toda la vida
Love the dj
Sin palabras
William Orbit&#39;s trance version from five years or so earlier than Tiesto is the one that gets me going, proper
In my space...
Omg yes this the style we do need to defeed the Corona💃🥂🕺
我聽的懂 我17歲的音樂
Q
Mix it was come with the church version
J&#39;ai tabassé mon pote, parce qu&#39;il écoutait d&#39;la TECHNO ! j&#39;ai tabassé mon pote parce qu&#39;il écoutait DJ TIESTO !
I think many people who don&#39;t love this kind of music are not able to understand how sentimental this is.
You're right. Because we understand how sentimental Barber's version, the orchestral and the original version, was. We understand how THAT version was heartrending in every way, making you feel an abundance of strong emotions rather than cheap hype that this video makes you feel.
This is history!

I am now 65. My daughter, now 43, introduced me to Tiesto's music years ago. Still love it. My daughter met him and airbrush tattooed him when he was on the Gold Coast in Australia.
La mejor canción de música electrónica en su extensa definición. Artística, potente, reflexiva. Trance en estado puro.

This reminds me of dmc 4
COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again. <br>The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome. <br>However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA. <br>There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one. <br>If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour. <br><b>(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)</b> <br>This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE! <br>The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tatoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do. <br>When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance. <br>My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered! <br>The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul. <br>The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now. <br>YAHUSHUA, JESUS THE CHRIST. 135

As the Dark Lord arrives, our heroes all unite together. Corruption spreads at a rapid rate throughout their world, but not enough to stop what remains left of the core. In the ultimate climax, the heroes combine forces, and take Him on.

Got an autograph from Tiesto back in the day, straight from the dj boot he was playing in. He played @ the palace in Groningen then. The one thing i remember from that gig was that he mixed &#39;lethal industry&#39; with &#39;breathe - prodigy&#39; so well that the mere idea of hearing it again brings back goosebumps
حقين النضيم موجودين؟؟
Ich vermisse diese Zeit so verdammt dolle...
Da gebe ich dir vollkommen recht.
Früher gab&#39;s kein Hass,<br>in unserer Szene. WIR HABEN EINFACH NUR GEFEIERT .. ♥️
ach scheiß die Wand an, Hass gabs immer, in der Rave Szene gabs den sowieso nie weil Molly zu gut war :P
That drumfill was ahead of it&#39;s time I&#39;m telling ya
OMG I FINALLY FOUND IT!! SOMEONE PINCH ME!!
I smoke crack to this...takes u higher than u think
But is it better than the William Orbit version? Elements of it maybe, but I prefer the William Orbit because it&#39;s closer to the classical original by Samuel Barber. If anyone loves either version and hasn&#39;t heard the original, well worth a listen even if you&#39;re not into classical music!

My brother used to listen to this 12 years ago, now i&#39;m a well taught man thanks to him
Enjoyable arrangement. As always, true masterpieces come from the gifted mind of a classical composer, in this case, Samuel Barber.
The best song from 2007, and now it is allll memories ...<br> I love you dad... thank you for letting me know that song when I was a child.. Now, when I miss u I am listening to that song and i remember you when you were there... Also the day you telled me <br> -hey, Come listen to something, Close your eyes and feel the beat <br><br>I still see your smile and it make it cry...<br><br>❤️ 😓<br>Adagio for strings is <br>Memories for life<br><br>Thank you Tiesto ❤️

This features in the Irish hit series Love Hate. If you haven&#39;t seen it, its a must watch.
It just gets better
I want all 3 versions, starting with the string one, followed by brass, and the ending with this one. If anyone knows a slower, more house vs techno version, please post. Thanx.
@Robbie Burton I'm going back to see my ortho on the with, which also happens to be my b-day. So, not 1, not 2, but 3 for the price of 1 hope, if u catch my drift. I'll spend my b-day out of this stinking joint. Fare there well.
@Robbie Burton still waiting for my appointment with the ortho, then meds. The Tramadol is all I want. This is not a forum for this, but thanx.
@Suzanna Bienkowski good. I hope the meds work and made you feel awesome😏😏
@Robbie Burton thank you, it was a traumatic 30 min in a metal box, but I made it. Next, ortho appt in week 1/2, with proper meds prescribed thereafter.
@Suzanna Bienkowski hope that MRI goes well.
@Robbie Burton Already had Adagio for Strings, and Adagio for Brass, and just found Agnus Dei, A happy coincidence this time. I'm going for an MRI today, so I'll be needing these.
@Robbie Burton thank you. I found all together 3, with a live one from Prague. Much better, I will add these to my specialized Adagio library.
Check out ferry corstons version.

Adagio for strings la canción q unió al mundo en el año del 2022 después de la terrible pandemia, hubo muchos muertos países devastados, cada vez los humanos desconfiaban de los únicos sobrevivientes pero solo la música electrónica pudo nuevamente reunirnos a todos sin importar religión, raza, posición económica y sin importar tu origen pudo sacarnos nuevamente una sonrisa una lágrima de los ojos y nuevamente supimos quien somos en realidad que no venimos a el mundo por dinero sino que a disfrutar de la vida, vivir la vida como si no hubiera un mañana <br>Solo la música electrónica pudo reunirnos nuevamente a todos y juntarnos como los hermanos q somos <br>I Love tiesto

Oh you are so naive
It hasn’t ended yet sadly bro I’m currently listening to this song at 10:20 am withought any sleep
Maybe after the pandemic ends there will be more than four bars' worth of music in this song.
F@ck off
First of all this is not a song and secondly, there is no pandemic .

En plena cuarentena escuchando a todo volumen saludos desde Argentina Buenos Aires.

The main melodie is composed by Samuel Barber. Agnus Dei, arr. adagio for strings. He was the real genuis.

I&#39;m 35 and miss the shit out of clubbing to this. I&#39;m gonna stick glowsticks to my ceiling fan and blast this in my loungeroom and relive my teens.
Now this sounds like a good idea
Same age mate and feel the same. 36 on this coming Wednesday 🇬🇧🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
age is just a number Rochelle ...m 40+ still trip on it
I shall copy haha im 31 yayyyy yyyeeeee
Me to im also 35 miss the good old days pal
Ur comment just gave me genuine help and joy
Stick em up your arse and shit lasers.
34 and i know exactly what you mean 🍻
Does everyone in the U.S have ceiling fans? I don't know a single person who does.
I'm 35 too.. Realized at 30 I'm going to still be going out dancing and clubbing until I no longer can lol Still love the music and getting out there enjoying it--that's all that matters <3
These were the times when I danced to it...
Hey, I'm 40! Still feels young and dangerous!
Am in, 😂
Lol sounds like a plan!
Am 50 next year, and I still love this music, xxxcxxxxx
You got your 50th like and I chuckled too. go the trance generation!!
Or you could go out when places are open again might take you longer to recover though lol
don't pull a muscle! :-P
@Jack Lewis good 1
I was clubbing until 40! Get out there (when covid is over.)
Add a few lazer pointers and dry ice then you have the live show in your room
Tiesto is a legend
Uma das Melhores de todos os tempos com certeza!
best song ever in mankind
хорошо поёшь!😂😂😂😂
🔊🍭🤯
This is class but doesn&#39;t touch the Ferry Corston version imo
Engraçado... Já comecei comentando num Armin Van Buuren e agora aqui, bem sincerão.. por conta da popularidade e a importância desses DJs pra toda a cena e gêneros em si (compõem a história da música eletrônica). Faculdade incompleta de Produção musical eletrônica; Eu curto funk soul disco r&amp;b trip-hop, Reggae Ska Dub até Jungle, rock variados sub-gêneros, psychedelic trance variadas vertentes, ouço muito hip-hop.. enfim, tá ligado? Me fazem amar música. E o Trance não me desce kkk o mesmo pro dubstep.. Assim como o Emo rock, dark metal, Psycore.. considero tudo uma merda.. E voltando ao eletrônico, metade da house eu curto muito tipo acid house, e metade é muito zuado! Muito loco isso tudo kkk Contudo, penso sobre a forma de se apresentar oq é música eletrônica.. A diferenciação do que se engloba no Dance, ou no Eletrônica, ou o que é estritamente um Full-On
If you haven&#39;t experienced this song in a huge crowd with a million lazerlights flashing over your heads, you haven&#39;t truely lived.
@Mark Evans count me in on your goal
I mean he ain’t wrong
Its not like i didnt want to😫😫😫😫
Ibiza 2013 and the full place was jumping amazing 🎶🎶👍👍
I don't think it's legal to play this song for a multitude, anymore.
I experienced it through unmonitored surfing in the Y2K

Everyone in the UK & Ireland & all over the world 2021 we have a set with all the classics of the 90's & early 2000's a set that's going to last 24hours, hold a max of 100,000 people who's onit to bring back the memories for 1 night only, get InTouch I will be airing this in December 2020 I have £40k to make 1 mental night last for a lifetime 😂 who's with me and 300 others to build this and make it explode all over the world!!!!! 💯💯💯💯
@Mark Evans The crazy thing is that when I was a kid (I'm 44 now) I loved the music my parents were into. I still do. Then music continued to be good through the 90s and then I plainly and simply don't know what the hell happened. I stopped listening to the charts about 15 years ago, when the same artist was in the top 40 for six or seven different songs. Even stuff like Tiesto sounds dated now, sadly (not for us). It doesn't even have lyrics, but the creativity and pitch changes are magical.
It trully IS a brilliant club song. I loved it in Greek clubs 15 years ago.
I wish that happened to me
Nonsense, you missed life
@Ezwan Sarib Same here I love trance 🎹🥁 Especially the 90’s 💯🔥
Yehh got to see tiesto live in malaysia 13 years ago..miss the good old days
@Onyx Core 🤡
I lived ...so what if have didn't do that.
So true 🔥💯🎹😎
I experienced it exactly like that at Tomorrowland. Unforgettable, still gives me goosebumps!
poli 97 They are
@nadeem Asghar I helped the poor just the other day. You don't know me and what I've done. I've even saved two women from robbers before. Zero friends? Nah. I have four. I have hundreds of facebook "friends" but most of them I've never even met. They want to be my fb "friends", and I am polite so I accept their invitation. I didn't say there are murderers and rapists in a big crowd to make me look good, so you lie about my intention and mentality, which makes you very malicious and nasty, and unrealistic. You are just proving my point right. :-)
Sensation white and tiesto..nice memories👍
@SCINTILLAM DEI realist lol put yourself in the 'I'm better than you' boat. Bet you 0 friends and you've never helped a person out from the bottom of your heart.
@SCINTILLAM DEI you are expecting more than what is available. Your own fault. You sound suicidal, which I hope is not the case pffft I have high standards also but I know not everyone will match these standards so I accept friends will have faults, so will I. All that matters is that as long as the main criteria is accounted for everything else doesn't really matter...the faults make people human. I can only imagine what faults a person like you has...a person who thinks themselves as perfect...good luck with life. Seems you've already given up....can't help depressives like you that lose the will to live. Go and create a club with like minded people and take your negative useless shit eksewhere
@nadeem Asghar "you are just a negative person" is a very negative thing to say. :-) If you have high standards, almost everyone is bad company. You have low standards, so it's easy for you to find "good" company. I'm a realist. Optimists are in denial.
@SCINTILLAM DEI well if you choose bad company then that is your own fault. We can choose who we spend time with. If you are depressed and trying to say all people are bad then do one...you are just a negative person.
I wasn't born back then you know...
@nadeem Asghar Better alone than with bad company. I won't lower my standards to fit in.
@SCINTILLAM DEI no one can tell who a murderer or rapist is. Could have one in your family...who knows. There are bad people everywhere, it doesn't mean you live life in solitary confinement. Humans are sociable creatures by nature, if you go against this grain you will only hurt yourself more.
Luckily I have experienced it last year at Tiesto set :)
Pretty sure there is much more to life than attending a concert
@P mine too and I'm 41 😁
@Zip0h3ight I didn't criticize this music, so no need to be angry and insult me with an accusation you pulled out of thin air.
@SCINTILLAM DEI just because you're a terrible person doesn't mean that everyone who listens to this music is.
How many rapists and murderers are in that crowd? Better to be alone in this room on the laptop.
EDC 2013 hearing this during the night owl experience while peaking on everything was truly a life changing moment for me, almost a biblical spiritual experience, so much stimulation that it’s hard to put into words . Don’t go to massive festivals anymore but dancing to this song is something I’ll never forget
got to see Tiesto live at decadence on NYE. It was transcendental
Thanks for not rubbing it in.
I would love to get a bunch of 15 yr olds in a venue, proper light show, full blast , they will then realise what MUSIC is, not the waterdown crap played nowadays.
First Ecstasy experience with headphones in bed full volume... Felt like is was in a crowd with laserlights... Will never forget that experience
I prefer the classical original or the 1967 version. Alone with my eyes closed really feeling the emotion of it all.
Everytime I listen to this song, I close my eyes and imagine that. Unreal feeling.
I remember being in the limelight in NY high off shrooms when this song came on & seeing the lights all over the dancefloor I thought I was glowing & just went off like the techno viking dancing for what felt like hrs.......... Great times......
Cant argue with that
I have not lived ☹️
too bad these songs are not really played nowadays
poli 97 😂😂😂
this is literally my life goal :(
Nothing beats seeing him live perform this
Such a throwback...
Ok boomer lol

Just imagine being in a rave in the early 2000&#39;s listening to this the feeling would be indescribable. The women around you and the ecstasy. The world
That was my life bruh fuck I miss them days I'm a parent now too long ago
I was in my late teens, early 20's during this time. It was everything you said and more! It was a marathon for your mind!

Really good! Greetings from Poland
Tiesto is never beaten, not by Armin van Buuren and not by Martin Garrix. Tiestio was from a much higher caliber. Tiesto is a real ARTist.
fajowa<br>nuteczka do drineczka
Haven&#39;t listened to this song since I was little, listening to it now and I&#39;m stunned.
I love you tiesto from moroco
I used to live and work 5500 ft up in the Hindu Kush, and this was one of the songs I have full volume ringing out across the valley while under the stars - BRILLIANT!!!
this song made me so happy 15 years ago now makes me cry so many memories and i thankful i still have the chance to listen and dance to this . Thank You Tiesto .
THE GENOCIDE 🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵
Great song for when fireworks go off.

This is the final song of the movie "platoon," which is not only an Oscar winner, but one of the most moving movies of all time. This gives me goosebumps every time I hear it

WTF 24k dislikes. I&#39;m seriously into electronic music. Everything from Shpongle to Autechre. Whether you agree with Tiesto&#39;s purpose for being on the music scene or not, this is a banging tune and you can&#39;t take that away. Turn it up folks 👍👍
Esta canción siempre que la escucho me trae Paz, Tranquilidad. La Amo .... #2020
Este tema marco un antes y un después en mi vida ... Trae muchos recuerdos estoy seguro que a más de una persona le pasó lo mismo. Es simplemente una obra de arte, no tiene comparación con los temas de ahora. Esto no es solo un tema, es un himno, casi 8 minutos de droga auditiva es la perfección ♥️
Casi 8 minutos que se hacen cortos,es una obra de arte,insuperable 😎
Merece la pena cada segundo!!

this song for me is a hymn just give it maximum volume and let yourself go
Para mi es un himno darle todo el volumen y solo dejarse llevar.
Así se habla

I can only wish all my favourite past artists never delete any of their masterpiece songs(in distress in the name of present insecurity infront of present artists) coz, they never know, when I can feel starving to listen to all of their old songs! <br><br>I&#39;m grateful to all the artists out there for making my life memorable with their beautiful compositions and carrying forward them to the present and future generations! It feels both magical as well as mysterious to imagine the quality of songs came from 1930&#39;s!!! Excuse my bad English though!
this song was a good part of my high school man
@V Rauch That's what I'm doing ☺️
Support your favorites and show them how grateful you are :D buy their music and enjoy it forever :P

This song is the equivalent of finding the last puzzle piece lost under the sofa cushion, but while you&#39;re pulling out the sofa cushion you also find a $20 bill. Long live Tiesto!

Un grande tiesto dance a full desde Tucumán Argentina
TIËSTO da godfather of electronic music.
@Herr X your English is very good, I totally understand what you are saying and you are right, I grew up in the late 80s early 90s when house music was first making its way to the UK, there are many great DJs from that time making brilliant dance tracks, Tiesto was just basically re-mastering old dance music, much of which had long been created and mixed properly by the likes of Sasha, John Digweed, and many others, Dance music was past its best by the time Tiesto started 👍
@onkouth im 30 years Old. My first real Rave was in 2007. So im Too young to feels like you and Your point of view. But i think there is basicly not ONE godfather of this Kind of Music. And if there is one its absolutly not tiesto.. maybe this guy from "i cant get no sleep" is one of them. I dont know. But there Are to many of genres and different typ of music-art to say one guy is the godfather. This is my point of view. Sry for my really bad english but i think you know What i mean 😅
@Herr X absolutely right, in fact if you’re anything like me you would have already come to the end of your best clubbing years by the time he existed!
No. He Really isent.
2020 like !
It&#39;s like 2008. What a good day.

So fucking good song. Always Tiestoo
Dont forget Samuel Barber

Сделал же шедевр Барбер! Песня даже в ремиксе цепляет.
Horrible. Not everything works if you put a beat.
<b>ies</b>
Why don&#39;t hear the original music. Adagio de barber. In my opinion is better.
This is what are the best house tracks I&#39;ve ever heard
God im getting old

Dj Tiesto&#39;s music is like my antivirus for coronavirus
Oh well 🎻

To take a composition made in 1936, that was usually played during funerals and tragedies and turn it into a trance anthem, just holy shit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adagio_for_Strings">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adagio_for_Strings</a>

why dont they just make the mouth wash you use every time you brush your teeth swallowable and kill the corona virus in your system?
to kill the corona virus you have to inject the mouthwash into the vein, trust me my uncle is bill gates
Only after listening to these tracks one can tell how much less people know about that flow in music ... No language/religious boundaries ....

Esta rola en medio de la cuarentena uuufff
Столько лет прошло, но этот трек не устарел нисколько! На дворе 2020 год, а я все так же тащусь от этого трека, как и в тот день, когда впервые его услышал🔥🔥🔥

It´s a question of mind.I´m 49 and grow up with Mayday Techno. I couldn´t make things like him, don´t missunderstand. But forget this age-Bullshit

God’s gift to EDM... Tiesto
punio
2020 🤗🤗🤗❤❤❤
A divine melody. Unforgettable.
A classical tune written way back that will forever stand the test of time. I think Tiesto has done this tune justice. <br>I look forward to more classical music mixes. <br>Pete Tong played a blinder too blending classical artists .....
Sorry i may soung like a noob but what is this genre of music called
@KnowName thank you so much
Vikas Sarang it’s uplifting trance i guess 😊
Mega
OMG
lockdown making us all listen to old masterpieces
2020... still love it... <br>🎶🎶🎶🎧😎🎧🎶🎶🎶
When the bass hits tho! Been off the trance/house music for like 5/6 years, felt like i had to give this a listen! &lt;3
in Lithuania even people in 80s know who&#39;s Tiesto
In Poland also people born in 90s know who is Tiesto ;)
I've been in his concert in Vilnus in 2007
Tikrai taip!

This is pure magic-mastercrafted sounds at its purest of the pures crystal top!
Damn this brings back memories! Hahah remember always working out to this song back in high school days pumping out a fuckload of pushups keeping up with the beat 😂
I was 15 when i listened this trance for the first time and now i am 25. I used to imagine as if i am in a dense forest and sun shine isn&#39;t falling on me and i am in search of it while listening to this trance. And here i am still searching the way out of the forest. Man that was the time when music meant something. Dj teisto, dj blend, armin van buerue. <br><br><br>Take me back !
SUNDERLAND TURN UP

Big shout out and and massive respect!!!. Always played this track in raves and clubs and not a single soul surfer stood still. But this track always reminds me of the sacrifice the brave men and women did in pass and present wars for our freedom to be able to enjoy tracks as this.

My dad always played this when i was like 1 yo and we danced together. My mom has a picture of me and my dad dancing, dad holding my arms so i can stand. Then my parents broke up and my dad were so sad he almost forgot this song. I’ve been looking for this song since i got my first smartphone. I’m 14 now and i’m literally crying because this song brings so much memories. Tiesto have always been in my and my dad’s heart.
You were born in 2006
You've always got family here
Im sorry but I honestly though this comment was satire LOL

Awwww that’s beautiful memories, trust me your parents still have love for one another. Who knows maybe one day they get together , I know stories like those , that have a happy ending. Stay happy and you are loved. Keep your head up and wishing you and your family all the best. ❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹💕💕💕💕🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
It's dramatic. But it is written well, very lively.
@Gamercatsz haha congratulations and introduce your kid to this treasure ;)
Boy be prod of you and your dad this HOLLY .....this wil not come so fast but RESPECT......and never FORGERT GR Bobbb
You dont produce memories as a one year old lol
@Nap Time I'm not giving an opinion am I child
@HeN MaN I did. But in the other hand, no oneasked for your opinion kid.
No one asked bro

Fuck you and your smarthphone. Ridiculous!!!
be happy little bro ..
Bullshit
Neko chan Gaming shut up bitch ur so mean
You are very weak in Math I guess.
God, you just aged me like a million years.
almost the same happend to me, my dad used to listen to a lot of electronic music in the car then my parents divorced. good memories. Its good to know somebody my age also likes this music< hope life goes well for you and fair well.
kiddo ... take a jurney in music .. learn something from this memory,become a dj ... maybe it`s a messege from lord, Good luck kiddo dont be sad... music is a way to release the pain
Good 4 u Kid !! all the best and ya daddy knows the best , c ya ...
i don´t cry you cry... haha ...no i cry, beautiful coment
Wish you the best in life man 🙌
Ok TIESTO has to see this comment! Im 34 and have been obsessed with this track for exactly 14 years.
Go dance with your dad
dude you hit me right in the feels, I just became a dad recently.
same here
Lucifer Fallenangel bro stfu
Neko chan Gaming I could say a lot of things about you but don’t you feel horrible inside. Like how were you brought up to be like this I don’t understand. I would never in my life say such things or even come close. Like even if you may be joking it’s just not right like we all know it’s not funny but even if you’re just not serious you just don’t say these things it’s like telling your mate yeah cry bitch when his mother or father died as I said it’s not right kid. I hope you weren’t raised up like this :(
you had no memory as a 1 yr old mate. nice lies
Yeah my dad used to always play it too. My parents ended up getting a divorce and now I’m 13 myself I find this and it brings me back to then
Your danced at 1yo xD
Yoir DAD was playing it..... OMG I'm fucking ancient!
# Fabiii yes
@LxK3ez oh come on it's no use complaining each other just chill and listen to one of the best songs in this universe...
are we brothers? this happened to me too... I turned 14 two weeks ago exactly
I don't understand not english.
@Jax people with your attitude need to rule the world. Seriously, I wish more people had your optimism. When I see others being happy, it reminds me to be happy, too. :) Thank you.
atlteast your parents are alive cherish that bro :D im 21 in uni and both mine are long gone still have good memories tho i aint sad you celebrate ones death to be braver etc theyre in a happier place always be in a good mood thats how i see when someone close dies to me heck if i died i want it to be a party xd
Dude... I'm twice your age, but take it from me: I completely relate to your feelings. My parents split when I was your age. I have not seen that promised "happiness" that one of them guaranteed me, and I live my life, immersed in good music like this, to help me escape reality. People all around me always saying "Allen get a grip dude, get to know your own self better," well, it's music like this where I get to "know myself." It might be kinda rough for ya right now, but trust me: you'll be happy when you're able to start your own family. (This is coming from somebody that's never even had a relationship, but still.) I've been actively involved in many-a family's life. Watched kids grow from 7 to 18 in the blink of an eye... (the 18-year-old still hugs me every time he sees me. I'm not bothered in the slightest by that.) I want you to enjoy and embrace every good memory you have. I relive moments in my life quite often. "Oh so-and-so you just think it was better back then" NO, it WAS better back then. I didn't THINK it was better, I KNOW it was better. All we can do, as we grow, is make the best with what we have. I hope you find some encouragement in this message, young man. 👍 I'm Allen, I'm all ears if ya ever need to chat.
I literally just found this again after years. This is one of the originals for me that got me into Edm
i'm listening to this with my 1yo child now =)
Lincoln Orcutt kid cry 😂😂😂 u get beat by ur parents
i have nothing like that with my dad damn you made me cry thank you have to get somthing like it with my daugther
The same thing happened to me, but I'm 18 :')
why is this same situation so relatable and the fact that im 14 as well woah...
@SYNIVONS to you AND thru you
Potato is good same here

Music has a way to take us away on a journey
Embrace it son x
this is true
Same, my dad passed and this was his fav song :( so this brings memories too...his love towards edm was passed to me tho 🥺
@LxK3ez fucking sad sack you are lad
the original song, than inspire to tiesto to do this one, has been considered by many persons, the most sad composition in the music history; but your history has something of happyness inside it. enjoy your memories and dance always than listen it.
And i thought my childhood was fcked up?!sounds like he was on still on xtc after a good afterhour party 🤣😅🤣😅🤣🤣
Potato is good 👍❤️🙏
@LxK3ez look im so cool because i act toxic.. YEAH GO CRY BITCH.... oh im so awesome because im toxic
Unlucky , sorry for the loss kiddo , I’ll be the shoulder you can always cry in 🙌🏻❤️
Brilliant memories, always keep the good ones. 👍

Can anyone tell me if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=3m50s">3:50</a> was used in any other music, remixes, movies, anything.......
Nevermind, I found that this was created by Samuel Barber.
Legend
Some of you tell me where IS DJ tiesto any informations about him ? Ilove this song still i play it loweder in my car.
Sentimientos encontrados la escuchó y veo pasar a mi familia a mi padre , madre . Hermanos y a mis hijas por mi cabeza y me da una pena inmensa no lo puedo explicar pero eso me pasa cuando escucho este tema. 🤙🤙🤙🤙 a pesar de eso que tremenda pista sacaste dj tiesto

Better than the trash he makes today.
Have you tried the new york album?
Trash &quot;music&quot; of the lowest order.
nostalgia:)
I played it so loud I couldn&#39;t hear what the lady was saying. I am only her therapist.
Does he still making live sets with this and traffic etc...?
Still my favorite song

Death to the Taiidan
Azerbaijan...🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
My favorite group is currently selling out and abandoned their sound, so I&#39;m reading comments from people that experienced this and it&#39;s helping my soul to see that people do move on and make peace with it. Shit&#39;s painful. But glad to see so many teisto fans came to appreciate the fact he was the god of trance for a time. I hope someday I can look back and be thankful my favorite group existed in such a beautiful state for a time.
I hate it when people sell out. An example of this is DJ Fresh. He used to make Jungle/DnB tracks and they were epic, but he wanted to get popular so he then started to make this shitty Dubstep and Pop DnB.

This music reminds me a lot of my family before the deepest moment of my life separates

27th January 2020 from Brazil here🇧🇷❤️
The original is better.
It&#39;s Samuel Barber&#39;s, Adagio for strings. Dedicated, from the composer, to the victims at Nazi&#39;s concentrations camps... 27.1.2020.
I remember the time i heard the track for the first time it wont stop gettin better.This track will never die.Mastepiece of Tiesto!
i remember my parents bought me a dvd with his performance, it had the full album, i was so amazed with all the lights of the concert, lasers and music, i was 9/10 years then, i listened the album for years, i know every single song from my head.<br><br>I am 26 now, time flies by.<br><br>I have not heard these songs for years!<br>I just came by out of luck, i saw a song of tiesto on spotify, it brought a tear to my eye to be honest, still get goosebumps.<br><br>it was this concert, they had a making of and explained everything, how they did the lighting etc, imagine, this was in 2003, that is 17 years ago and i still know everything about it<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z84vbsvuUQ4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z84vbsvuUQ4</a>

Loud!!!! 130 decibles perfect.
What a great work of art this track is, one that will never fade, one that will never be forgotten! Shame they can&#39;t produce such quality this day in age. Great track to blast out to on site via my Makita DAB at top end 💪, From the words of Wayne &quot; Party on &quot;
2020
This track would have been perfect for a new Midnight Club 5 announcing for it&#39;s release on a commercial or to be put on the games&#39; playlist when racing. Rockstar Games, make it happen already it&#39;s been 12 long years since Midnight Club Los Angeles.

Old Tiesto, where are you?
At loud volumes, this song is so awesome that my neighbor threw a brick through my window so he could hear it better.
my neighbor called the police to share this epicness with them
Understandable tbh 🥴
@Connor Kelly No, I just copied and pasted this comment to get likes. It worked.
Your closet has windows ?

Hell yeah!
Add me onnsnap kk323g let's gooo
can&#39;t believe this song came out in 1936. ahead of its time.
@cr o the nazi was Europeans too, but never mind.
🤣😂
@Siva Naidoo Also this. I know. A donkey, I think. Is it possible, to show ALL others how much dignity and performance/knowledge they have? Means, like an animal BEING a politician. He fucked his sisters with one he had childs (Bloodsister), cause it was more "forbitten", a taboo, than today. Not for him! This is really a full narcismen structure and dimension. But one experience in his childhood (very famous and high militair leader in germania) is a little bit explaining, not to be god by birth. You know the killing of his father in front of him? MAYBE, I´m not sure...
@Peter Goldstein my dude caligula promoted his HORSE to senator.. just 4 fun?
🍿🍿
Samuel Barber wrote this.
it didnt have all the base and the sound effects baclk then tho
Classical comment!
It's a song who cares what it's called
lololol
100%spot on what a masterpiece
@Otaku -kun no
Dave h Do you mean 1996 ? 😕
@Stevie Malley Oh? Want to offer to love Ausschwitz? Nice... Can you say something substancial, stupid?
@Peter Goldstein please tell me what drugs you are doing
Niggas listened to this tune in the 1936 Nazi olympics 🔥
@pillarofdawn or William Orbit, his remix is very good as well.
Its actually a classic but he made a remix
@zaostalyy No dude, Agnus Dei it is a piece for choir, for strings it's still adagio :)
😂 that was fun 🥀
What you talking about dude. This was playing when God first created the universe.
@T984e37 S That doen´s matter. You offer a group of Herrenmenschen (Narcissistic and everyone who serve this group in it´s ideology) and make some most stupid proofs by science or culture. The Basic is Narcissistic. The Rest is Hollywood. To explain to be not to obviously such an asshole. Super asshole. Caligula (not gang bang shit, he killed people on his parties, just for fun!), Hitler, Stalin, Pol Phot, etc etc Think about....
Ummm, what are you millennials talking about? This piece was composed in the late 1600's by Albioni...
@Shea Magee will since the nazi philosophy was based on viking and roman traditions I doubt it even if that reality happened joke or not lol
@Shea Magee You don't need to be condescending about it bitch
Daniel Pletikosić true, tiesto actually fought the nazis with this song, he played it and the nazi were dancing so the europeans could get them without fighting
The nazis didn't even stand a chance. Carpe vitae.
Agnus Dei might be the whole piece, but this movement is the adagio for strings.
@zaostalyy Not sure about that :p
It's not Adagio for strings by Samuel Barber but Agnus Dei by Samuel Barber :)
@GAME OF THROWS samuel barber adagio for strings, this is a remix of a 1930's classical music composition.
@pillarofdawn 😂🤦‍♂️ don't know why I mixed up apocalypse now and platoon. could of been high at time. deleted. at least they came out same time.😁
@dave h try Samuel Barber Adiago For Strings
Daniel Pletikosić the vikings played this in Rome when they were fighting the nazis ffs Learn some history
@Daniel Pletikosić it's the truth
yo what the ?
All my mother&#39;s half sister wanted was a time machine so she could have eternal youth but if you reverse time you create souless body&#39;s or maybe that&#39;s the state of I&#39;m awear that is used to corrupt the mind of a child as the adult tries desperately to figure out why aldine the movie can not fix a 4way Glock session to loose principal count from sesame Street to idk what is real in my head or just imagine based on torment that can&#39;t be rationalised<br><br>For gaining a Lillith.
Best track ever!

I want to rave in the 90s so fucking bad
Damn, so exclusive tune here, I mean is a pure trance masterpiece....Timeless
Absolutely pisses all over today&#39;s music back then these tunes were out every week now yr lucky to even find anywhere near it
@Ulysses same name, Adiago for Strings by Samuel Barber
Not speak english sorry.
You do realise it's a remix of a classical song and not created by the the dj just tinkered with. nicely done all the same .there is a lot of other great music since the original of this was made .dubstep hip hop r and b rock metal a lot of genres today are pushing boundaries for what the ear hasn't heard before with musicians electronic instruments and genius that the original creators of this music would of loved to get there hands on
Listen to Simon O Shine: Wuthering Heights. There are still amazing euphoric trance artists out there, you just gotta look.
ok boomer
I personally think another 5 rpm on this track and it would be better than sex .... mixed this tune into that many tunes like you wouldn’t believe
When you say back then - do you mean 1936? Coz it wasn't all as gd as that back then haha ;p
Still some good stuff out there. Don Diablo....Tiesto.
Don't be that guy every time period had good and bad music 😂
This song turns 16 this year, but it sounds so much more futuristic than current music.
Then you're not looking hard enough. Good music is everywhere, you just gotta search for it.
Legendary match ✨
Which DJ do you book to play in a supermarket?<br>Tiesco

9th of january 2020 and still one of the best Tiësto tracks ever!
@Quirky Purple facts he even copied Williams version and got more views
Tiesto is a bit of hack though. William Orbit did a dance version less than a decade before. So, even though none of them wrote Adagio for Strings, Tiesto is copying off someone copying a track. Talking about sloppy thirds :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNcdVuPVXR0
LMFAO, it's a remix of the original and the original was FAR BETTER. William orbit - adagio for strings
Deep house
Not speak english sorry.
Iconic
Indeed 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻

Still fucking awesome!!!! And now it’s 2020
Today my daddy is dead..it is he song😞😭😭😭👏🏾❤️💪🏽forever in my heart🙏🏻rest in peace daddy🇸🇰
Pedro Numbanine my father didnt see his grandfather ever since he was 4, he disappeared and my dad tried to get into contact with him but failed, he passed away 3 years ago at the age of 65.
sorry for your loss, rest in peace ❤️
Sorry for your loss.. 😥
Ummm I hope this is not real but if it is I'm sorry for your loss and if it's not real you are a kid just having fun and trying to get likes from bulshit
Your father had a great taste in music, may his soul rest in peace🙏
rip
I didnt your dad, im sure he will be dancin to this track & many more, its a top 1 to remember, have u seen tiesto?... If not, please do, it will be amazing for u & respect for your dad 🤗😇💪👊
Stay strong and strive to be the best version of yourself brother 🙏
He is now in the lords love and ecstasy also you will meet again
Baby love daddy
Not speak english sorry.
Mirthe Wolsink ❤️❤️❤️
God bless you and your Family. Stay strong ❤️❤️❤️
I'm so sorry for you daddy
Okie
Requiem In Pace
Mine died in the last month too...R.I.P. Papa habe dich lieb

Stay strong ! Must be so difficult
R.i.p 😥
Sorry for your loss, your Dad had great taste in music.
I’m sorry for your loss. May your father’s soul rests in peace.
😞😔😢
Fuck you if it's fake but I'm sorry if it's real.
Sorry for your loss man
Upřímnou soustrast.
I’m sorry for your loss.
be strong brother
Úprimnú sústrasť
@Pedro Numbanine it is nice to read you forgived him. It gives me a smile, i dont know why but i am smiling right now. I hope you enjoyed the time you did spend time with your dad. Even it was short. Of course you wanted to enjoy more than what you already did. But remember you DID enjoy the time you spend with your dad. Even the time was 1 sec. And to you to, dont forget your dad, ever. I am sure your father loved you. Maybe not on a way you wanted or maybe he did love you on a way you wanted. (Maybe my English is not that fluent that is because i am tired and my English sucks 😂)
Mirthe Wolsink honestly haven’t seen my father since I was 5 he was a huge tiesto fan... he passed away a few years back never got along with him but learned to forgive him and reading this just gave me goosebumps idk you but thank you for those words
So sorry for your loss. I didn't know your father but i am sure he was a good father. He learned you to listen to trance, that is one of the best things a father does. Music united us, especially trance music. I hope you live your life the fullest, enjoy every moment. Even is the moment 1 second, enjoy of this one second. Because life is to short. And i hope you find peace in the fact your father died, don't forget him, ever.
😭♥️
💔😭
Tamás Bédinek küldöm Speciálba ezt a zenét. ! .
Happy new year to everyone!!!!!!!!! who loves Tiesto🎅🤶
🌴👀🌴
Has to be one of the greatest dance anthems out there. Happy New Year to all when 2020 starts.
Happy new year 🥳 2020 <br>Peace and prosperity to all
Even in 2020 it&#39;s giving me goosebumps.This track is like wine, the older the better.
2021 brooooooo at 1:30 i get tears in my eyes dunno why xD over a decade it be like that xD i know this song for almost a half of my life xD im 30
The original was composed in 1936. It's older than most of our grandparents and great-grandparents lol
@Michael Ruiz well, you spoke some = anyway, you don't need to know English to enjoy this musicxx
Me too. Goosebumps.
@Mirthe Wolsink yo tenia 11 años cuando por primera ves escuche este track, y siempre que lo escucho me causa la misma sencacion como la primera ves q la escuche
I dont understand not speak english sorry.😠
@Joost Wasbauer video footage? lol, better remembering in ur head - the reality isn't as glamourous...
I'm 64 n love this lol!
This is LIFE GOOD MUSIC allright!!
Much better than the mainstream shit today, this song is legendary
I like your comment, i just dont want to ruin the 666 thumb ups :(
A will give you goose bumbs
Better than HydroxChloroquine!
couldn't be more wrong
Amen! Tiesto awesome tune
The best electronic track of all time
Trust 🥰🇬🇧🙌🍻
Maybe because it's still better than most of today's Trance music
I was surprised, but i've really got those goosebumps on my arms after maybe 10 years i haven't heard this track
Absolutely
@Joost Wasbauer all the way my brother! I have to agree with you 110% hands down! So glad you did ..... 🙏🔥
music made today is the worst but old songs are way better
Found it back then on napster, took 3 days to get it dowloaded.... still this is the best trance set (live at innercity Amsterdam) This was the real Trance DJ...i want video foutage !
@ApexGamer20 I am lucky to call this song childhood memories. I was 9 or 10 when I listened to this song. Now I am 20 and I got goosebumps from listening to this song
Well said!
Kids dont understand that old songs are better than now a days rubbish
Раньше было лучше
Just class...
You are definitely right!
Daniel Ilie Old style never dies
When I play this full blast out my car in 2019, I always wonder if people recognize it as they did back in 2005
It'd be kind of like playing 'PUMP UP THE JAM' or 'WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE' in 2005. Most people would be like "yeah I've heard this somewhere but I dunno what it's called"
Better than any of the Spotify versions
Fly high Damian, this is just for you. Gone too soon in Dec 2017 xx

Tiesto is NOOB! King of covers. OMG !!!!!
I&#39;m would of loved to be there
Very good💕💕💕
Adagio for String is the soundtrack of the film Platoon by Oliver Stone.
With Charlie Sheen ! And William Dafoe.
Technically this is a rip of a rip. The original tune is Agnus Dei.
Oh how the great Tiesto has fallen... so sad to listen to his new crap, generic EDM for the masses.
Still one of my favorite choons!!!
Suena como al soundtrack de la película platoon o parece?

way better than the crap he&#39;s making today, 00&#39;s tiesto was the best.
He is actually back with something more melodic now with his new VER:WEST alias
@Soldado de Dios - not bad for 1936 is it?! :)
@Cool Crush Ice Killa same name funnily enough
@Cool Crush Ice Killa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izQsgE0L450
He's not making anymore?
No one is making anything today.
Proabably because this is a remix of a super famous classical piece
Garbage compared to William orbit version. The first part feels completely disconnected to the main theme. And when the beat rejoins after the strings part it looses all feeling 👎
Uno de los temas mas épicos de todos los tiempos...
Felt &amp; still feels schizophrenic ... when I heard it first &amp; still going in 2020 ... it never stops the rush that gives u first time hearing it .. LEGENDARY
Why did it make you feel like that?

This track is legendary.

More than legend
Truly Agreed!!!!!!!
Originally by Samuel Barber, the transcendence of neoclassical composition into the EDM field; fucking dope
I believe it was in the movie Platoon

Endlich hören meine Nachbarn gute Musik....
never understood rave music, but do appreciate such noise to set up my system as it envelopes every spectrum of sound
@XMedian003X 😂🤣😂 Think rave died out.
its trance
drunk and so lazy ¥
It is good and melodistic .. But slow :(
no apology for fucking anyone
yes i did all those yokes
Jest tu ktoś z Polski?
Sad truth is, you&#39;ll never get DJ&#39;s producing analogue classics like this. I mean, you still get bangers, but they aren&#39;t made like they used to be. Digital format has taken over
This tune is awesome 😁💃💃🥰
Sadness
Vamooo exe jonan partiendola ai ke pim ke pam vamoooo vamoooooo
still love this song :)
After a very long time I have listened to Adagio on my way to work today ... the louder it was playing the more emotions it was bringing ...had to stay in my car for a little longer as I cried like a baby, right there at the car park ... &lt;3
fuck, im feel so old. but i love it!!
Yıl olacak 2020 hala dinliyoruz
Whenever I’m at a rave an I hear this I always think it’s a sad song just the notes and how they fit together don’t get me wrong I’m usually off my tits but I always think it’s a sad remorseful track
Richard wood Wood yes?

Yo tambien
Awesome as always. I was kid when this masterpiece was made.
It should say adagio for strings by Samuel Barber
the dude I’m not an idiot, I’ve studied Adagio for Strings (1936) for a competition. I know it was originally composed by Samuel Barber. But you don’t have to give credit in the title. *If you take the time* and look at the licensing information, you’ll see Barber as the writer of the song. That’s credit where credit is due. I see no issue here.
@Connor Neely if you take the time and look up the song adagio for strings and listen to the melody it is adagio for strings HENCE the name derrr
@Connor Neely yes it is Adagio for Strings is Samuel Barber. That is the melody dumb dumb. Please I cant deal with non sense
But this song isn’t by Samuel Barber
This is fun but should not be taken as an artist. People you can&#39;t be an artist if you program thecssme tired techno beats and then take famous pieces of music. I just dont understand what you a think this is. This isn&#39;t like Queen or Pink Floyd and real music. It&#39;s a music programmer not a musician not an artist NOT amazing talent. Itz a wonder why these programmers have people idolizing them its foolish. You pay and 1000s load into an arena for someone who never dedicated themselves to an instrument. I&#39;m sorry it is what it is. This music was created by Samuel Barber a classic composer and it&#39;s not created by this man rest his soul. He gave people fun like if I brought a co mixtapes to a party. This is honesty so please save the hate
🎊
That fat rolling bass kick!
This is a tune listening to this song 4ever

I remember rocking the dance floor in the opening night in amnesia in Ibiza when I was 18 to this 🤯 I took some MDMA that some Espanol dude gave me and my girlfriend at the time for free. I gave it socks along with the rest of the crowd when this tune came on. Some memories from that summer I lived over there for 3months ✌️❤️
❤❤❤🎵🎶🎧💓
Good old Tiesto. Lately he hasnt been at this level on producing songs
Its a remix
@Dio Brando и есть легенда

Nice to hear the original, I think Samuel Barber made an orchestral version of this.
Best time of my life was getting my dick sucked to the beat of this song.

Purrfecto! Still coming back for this in 2019

Samuel barber would be proud
crap
El jonan
Dude it&#39;s the first time Barber&#39;s Adagio makes me actually wanna die.
Don’t think there is anything close to matching this,TRUE PERFECTION!
Yeah children miles , kerkraft 400 and le me Trajours are all bangers and this ofc
Children Robert Miles Faithless Insomnia
Mirage and pressure are the only ones close to this for me
If you haven't seen Tiesto's live dvd of this you're truly missing out. Absolutely incredible. The entire dvd is off the chart.
don't forget about Jon Vesta Gull and M.I.K.E Push blue midnight such classics as well https://youtu.be/64KaIomYIOs
Veracocha Carte Blanche says hello. That is one of the best old school trance tracks of all time
Bevin A absolutely,I meant in a trance sense
Accept the original piece :)

Te corrijo, es una genial adaptación al estilo Trance. Otra cosa es que no te guste. De hecho, hay una estrecha relación entre la música clásica y el trance ya que usan melodías muy parecidas en ambos.

Does anyone know where I can find the original one? This is almost it but it’s a little different towards the end. In the original there’s like this electric almost guitar sound around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=6m55s">6:55</a> part. This one doesn’t have it and it just totally ruins the entire song
Everlasting !!!!

Esto fue musica kien no aiga escuchado tiesto ke dios lo perdone
Escriba bien por favor!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=3m42s">3:42</a> Este tema tiene uno de los mejores subidones de todos los tiempos, junto a otras de anuscka y kultur, esto si es musica de discoteca para bailar y disfrutarla, no como la cochambre que hay ahora...
Ibiza...summer......2001.....oh yeah....😍✌️🎉
My song in my kickboxing taekwondo days, still gets me going zugabugadovv i take on the fkn lot of yas if you want, but violence isnt the key

Adagio + Weed will open eyes to the secret of life 🖤👁🖤
Better amphetamine or cocaine 😉
​@bear bear I think violence and war comes from nature ,Physical nature ,Material ... u can see it in everything like animals ,plants, even stars and galaxies and ... But when human can stopped this and understand that we are more than our physical body and material world then world changing will begin .it could happen even for every single people and change their own world ,but we have long way to changing whole world ... Humans are intelligent but its also can be good and bad for them.
​@ken smithOur world could be more beautiful if ppl just think about existence for few mins everyday. 🖤
@Eye Controlof course,I will try it on my first trip with Mushroom. 🖤
​@ken smith Yes thats true,this is full of energy .more powerful than any drug.it takes soul out of our body .I wanna try it on Mushroom.it could help me to more understand it
@Federico Favilli Yes ,its so strong and its natural when u can understand this music with your soul 🖤
I listen this after a splif and I'm crying
honestly this sounds better on mdma or shrooms than weed

This is absolutely one of my favorite tiesto songs of all time when I got the album just be I played this song over and over and over and over again and from that day on just be was one of my favorite albums the stuff that he makes now excluding club life volume 4 are garbage in my opinion club life volume 4 is amazing so yep
This is one of those songs that just doesn’t die. It’s HP and Defense/absorption is at meta level
Don't forget high regen to.
this tune is also saying &quot; I miss those times as well like you all guys&quot;
Albinoni would have an orgasm

This needs to be in the new need for speed game
I don't see this song being in a racing game, not in any game really, it just doesn't fit a certain genre
für mich völlig unverständlich, wie man ein klassisches Stück von Barber wie dieses dann so versauen kann ... Unglaublich
I can’t believe this only reached 37 in the charts in the uk. That is a travesty. What makes it to number 1 now is nothing in comparison. Best song ever.

I know my neighbors just loooooove this bumping through their walls at 3 in the morning, so let&#39;s crank it up!!!
Эта история, эта гармоничное музыкальное сочетание, эта шедевр! Данное произведение, не побоюсь этого слова, искусства, нужно приписать к ДОСТОЯНИЮ ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСТВА!
И вот только не надо меня обманывать, что с <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a> по <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=2m03s">2:03</a> вы не впали в чувство неописуемого восторга и мурашек по всему телу.
Thank you Samuel Barber 😁

Nobody:<br><br>Literally nobody:<br><br>Tiesto: Let&#39;s turn one of the saddest pieces of music ever composed into a club banger<br><br><b>Samuel Barber intensifies</b>
@Tillybex True story: First time I heard this, I started crying for no reason whatsoever. And then felt really fucking stupid for it. Ah, memories.
Totally fucking awesome. One of my all time favourite dance tracks ever. Genius.
😍😍😍
Revolutionary! right next to the first albums of Prodigy!
Just heard a &quot;remix&quot; of this on the radio. It was so awful I turned it off in disgust and came straight here to purge my ears with the one and only Adagio for strings. What a masterpiece this is.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=5m00s">5:00</a> dk daki müzik kulağımı tırmalıyor. ne yaptın tiestooo
I spin my flowtoys to this song at my brothers wedding last year March. Life isn&#39;t the same without him. Tiesto bringer of Trance. Everyone knew Tiesto. Music is so pure. I cry every time this specific song is played. as the song intensifies, I can hear everyone&#39;s cheering. When the song ended, he ran towards me we both cried. Gave me the warmest hug, and the whole crowd of people ran towards me. I started a party!! Like in the movies
Just heard this last night at Shoreline Amphitheatre . Nostalgia and borderline crazy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23firstrave">#firstrave</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=1m35s">1:35</a> &lt;3

Kyrsten Barrueto you are cute :3
Makes me feel like I am in Space.
When I play this in any car, the rear window lives in total fear
My God this track is still amazing, using my 7.2 surround system, let&#39;s just say the whole house is shaking plus my neighbors feel it, and that drop after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=5m15s">5:15</a> is godly.
I just read your comment the exact moment that beat dropped and i felt i was right with you
July 2019?
Yeah I Don’t Now Why Tiësto Change His Music
October 2019 and I’ll still be coming back here in 2050 if I’m still going
Yep

Nobody listens to techno
This is trance tho
PsycoVision 5 lmfao good one
Samuel Barber would love to have heard this seminal version of his work!
Godfather of Djs! Tiësto alive LEGEND!🔥❤️
Great track but if Tiesto is your "godfather DJ" then you need house/raving musical education mate!! Each to their own I suppose!! The real godfathers are Carl Cox, Sasha, Grooveridet, Frankie Knuckles,. Paul Oakenfold and the like, original acid house djs from when the rave seen all began in the late 80s!!
There was another song like this, but a woman was singing. Anyone suggest what the name of the song could be?
July 2019 BaNgEr.

11 years now? Holy shit... I remember going crazy with these songs. You’re a legend Tiesto, what happened to you? You became so mainstream so basic... :’( i remember being at your concert in Ibiza back in 2011, before the closing parties of the island, dang, those where parties 🤙🏽 Forever ♾ Timeless
babib11 mhm, so?
Dude, are you aware this came out in 2005?
Tiesto was a god.

Sorry but it&#39;s a song like this that makes you realise how much Tiesto has lost his way with the rubbish he produces today to please a radio audience.
alguien en el 2019?
Klasyk pierwsze prochy 30 godzin bez spania....
Está muy buena esa rrola
This is my favorite track ever it’s so legendary I wish someone could do exactly the same track just with a better sound quality
E pensare che Tiestto e&#39; diventato famoso copiando la nostra musica proggresiv . Prima di diventare famoso diceva che la musica proggressiv era una musica del CAZZO.... E anche vero che noi italiani già nei primi anni novanta gli abbiamo insegnato l&#39; early style. E gli olandesi e dj famosi di oggi , hanno copiato il nostro style.
And idiots who know nothing sneer at classical music. We wouldn&#39;t have music like this or any modern music for that matter without it.
I played it so loud my neighbour called the cops, they arrested him.
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂

Ahahaahahhahaaaa

@Nixie also it's a joke are you too oblivious to this sort your head out and gain a sense of humour which you ain't got
@Nixie you are boring but ignore the harshish comments made stop taking everything serious internet is one place that ain't serious about shit
@Nixie DUMB AS FUCK
@Nixie naaaa you don't get it tho
puss
😂😂😂😂😂
@Nixie Dunce
last time i heard that joke i nearly fell of my dinosaur ...
@Nixie pick 5: An intellect rivaled only by garden tools. As smart as bait. Chimney's clogged. Doesn't have all his dogs on one leash. Doesn't know much, bot leads the league in nostril hair. Elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor. Forgot to pay his brain bill. Her sewing machine's out of thread. His antenna doesn't pick up all the channels. His belt doesn't go through all the loops. If he had another brain, it would be lonely. Missing a few buttons on his remote control. No grain in the silo. Proof that evolution CAN go in reverse. Receiver is off the hook. He has less going on upstairs than a one story house. Several nuts short of a full pouch. Skylight leaks a little. Slinky's kinked. Surfing in Nebraska. Too much yardage between the goal posts. A few clowns short of a circus. A few fries short of a Happy Meal. An experiment in Artificial Stupidity. A few beers short of a six-pack. Dumber than a box of hair. A few peas short of a casserole. Doesn't have all his corn flakes in one box. The wheel's spinning, but the hamster's dead. One Fruit Loop shy of a full bowl. One taco short of a combination plate. A few feathers short of a whole duck. All foam, no beer. The cheese slid off his cracker. Warning: Objects in mirror are dumber than they appear. Couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. He fell out of the stupid tree and hit every branch on the way down. Not the sharpest knife in the drawer. The lights are on, but nobody's home. 24 cents short of a quarter. A few bricks shy of a full load.
@Nixie you should get arrested for this comment.
Perfect trance www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBJTNI7NIFM
@Tatiana Romonov lol 😜
@Nixie if if it's the landlord playing and the tenant calling, the landlord usually has leverage...😕
@Nixie This is what happens when you act on instinct :) You are right, but apparently, it was supposed to be a joke. And also apparently, you committed a crime by not asking for the gang's mercy. Children can jump on anyone for attention, and at the end of the day, you are the so called idiot. This is almost an art of this new (de)generation...
hahahaha.. nice one.. actually those cops are trance hardcore fan
@Nixie okay...
Doubtless this is a great version of Mr Barbers adagio.What is also without doubt is that there are also an awful lot of nit wits listening to it.
This comment section is gold
@Hrithik Jayanth maybe he wears a helmet always. Lol
@Güven Toprak https://youtu.be/B3EBs7sCOzo
Acá le dejo mis dies
@Nixie Ze doctor ist here, alles ok?
@Daniel McCluskey HAHA thats funny haha.. But i can not condone this behavior !
Lollllll
Classic well done. People don't appreciate great tunes these days. Rather call the feds.
@Nixie go to sleep
The cops have common sense 😅
Nixie Fidora estupido
My gf called the cops on me twice and both times she went to jail.
That’s incorrect my gf called the cops on me and she got arrested. My friends brother always calls the cops on my friend and the cops bring the brother to jail every time. Using the cops for petty shit is more likely to backfire on the bitch complaining.
Fuck you
marvelous!!
Try. I played this so loud my neighbour called the cops and the bass was that loud it was like the maxwell clip with them trying to walk up to mine. May not be the funniest but at least it was original
@Nixie I am two months late, but right on time to call you an idiot for not getting the joke.
mephistopheles nah he‘s just a german.
That's cool bruh
😂😂
this actually made me laugh
Meh
@Nixie You made a stupid choice. Sorry. :/
@OciYz what did i do tho ;-;
@Nixie Just stop. You're just embarrassing yourself at this point.
@Nixie r/woooosh you mongoloid
@Nixie no shit sherlock
Poor nixie everyone gangin enjoy the music 🎶 no hate celebrate!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️God Bless You Brothers And Sisters God Loves you
Hahaha totally awesome fricken classic.
Bunch of brain damaged scrawny teens being toxic to me for correcting his story, i know it was made up, i know the joke and you idiots are still going at me, how pathetic xD
@Nixie Humour 100
ahahahah
How unoriginal
Agrees with the comments here....when I played this track at 1:00 a,m, my neighbor in the next town filed a formal complaint with the Authorities about my LOUD music...so I play it at 2:00 a.m. Problem solved!
@Nixie Everyboday knows you're the only idiot here. rofl.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nixie Fidora you must be fun at parties
You are full of shit dude
Xaxaxa😂😆
@Nixie it amazes me to know people like you exist.
Idiods will never die
@Nixie omg your skull is so thick.
Hahahaha, didn't saw this comment before. Good one!
@Nixie you must be funny at party...
@Nixie maybe because the caller was a deranged guy, we never know...
@Nixie Am doctor ur prescribed with death juice :D 💉
@Nixie You're dumber than a skinned cabbage
Lol it’s sound funny 😂
@mephistopheles i knew it was made up lol, sorry for talking some sense into idiots like you
@Nixie Everyone knows the story is made up except you apparently. Hence the lack of a sense of humor on your part.
@mephistopheles I was just correcting his made up story
@Nixie r/wooooshsoharditbreaksrecord
@Nixie /\---- zero sense of humor

Everyone who raved in the 90s but grew up in the 80s knew it from the film Platoon. Great haunting choon even before Tiesto did this. Samuel Barber created the original. Can make you cry!!!

Absolutely boring as fuck as it’s possible to be. You could teach a fucking monkey to do this. He’s taken a brilliant piece of music and shat all over it. Think up your own little melodies, Dj Turd. this is just a trendy Boston Pops Orchestra.

Nostalgia...<br>Edit: Im so so glad i got this music on one of my CD&#39;s...
2019?
If not Samuel Barber&#39;s Adagio for Strings there would not be Tiesto&#39;s remix
@perushul_argintiu Lol. I have no idea why you said it. I have no idea how you compared Albinoni and Barber. Also I think you should read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adagio_in_G_minor
@perushul_argintiu LoL. No.
I saw Tiesto at Amnesia in Ibiza in 2005, at his height... he was such an awesome DJ back then. Now, he&#39;s a shell ....
The mainstream destroyed very great artists like Tiesto
Edgy
Very motivating song and I still Rock this tune today
Kaç sene önce vay be böyle bir saglam parça yoktu bile o zamanlar günün fenomen şarkısıydı belkide😂😂😂

Absoluter schwachsinn wie kann mann mit so etwas berühmt sein bullshittt. Of music 🚫👎
Roses are red tomatoes are blue, this song raises memories, I forgot that I knew, spots all around me, living it large, tunes like this to the dance floor we charge, all get your places, the rush it then comes, everyone happy, chewing our gums, forget our worries, that life will provide, but this fucking tune, is one hell of a ride. When we see faces, familiar peeps, where are you from, what you had, what&#39;s your name, the questions were sad, the answers unheard, but pretend that we did, cos love in this house, was free let us give, colourful tunes, dance like a twat, but who the hell cares, when they are all on tap, love o the raver, child of the night, this tune never dies, it is fucking delight, that we share when we dance, when in hardcore unite, where darkness creeps in, this tune will show light. It&#39;s not bang bang bang, in a ketamine fight.
mahşer günü muziği:D:D:D:D::D:D:

Everytime i was in my old car this song was blaring
Of this electronic was the one I fell in love with, missing these old times
I can’t belivie that this song is from 2004
one that gets me motivated... to dance!!!
You hear it once then you can retire...Epic feelings all over...Adagio for life...
Check out my Adagio for Sreets remix. (barber&#39;s cut part 1 &amp; 2)

37 years old and I still feel like I&#39;m 18 listen to this tune!! Timeless n absolutely epic time of my life!
55 and still blasting this. Such a classic
trance is not dead ! happy new year 2020 !🏵🧨🎇🎆✨🧨🎶🐱‍🏍👍
51 yo. Raver and Metalhead until the end of my days...
@Ash Kiff you will reach a time in you're life to kid. Wise up. 🤘
37 aswell an all I do is think about them days ,happiest days of my life 😥
oh man 33 feels like 16
But musica, has nothing to do with your age señor...
You couldn't be 18 as this was released in 2004😂 22 mate, easy math😁
It was released in 2008?
Boomers had reeeeal nice EDM
No age for this
@pagansforbreakfast no no its all good darl don't be
@pagansforbreakfast 😊 im a madam darlin but for sure your welcome thats so cool
just like me :)
@pagansforbreakfast nice quote (the outsiders)
@Gary Fletcher never too old What they dont realise its been around longer than them lol and myself aswell
@Paulo Ando kudos 😎
😎
Feels weird being 18 reading this comment
Same here child of 83!!!!🙌👆✊
44 n feel the same
me too. takes me to miami club Space.
You are focKing right! THIS IS ART! I love it so much... 40 Years old, 31 Years Techno!! <3
YAAAAAAA me too excellent it s remember The Cherry Moon Lokeren belgium !!!!
Im 34 and married and still the goosebump .. the feelings inside me ... girls drugs and music. Fuck yeah. I know it maybe not sound too good but to be honest it was fuckin awesome.
FORTY!!!
@Im Chipp Was the last of his Trance before he went into House, but he's epic regardless.
SAME AS MATIE ALLWAYS 18 OR 21 IN MY HEART , ITS MY HEART THAT CANT KEEP UP LOL .... ALL THE BEST CHAPIE ....
Wait until you get to 60 mate it will sound even better!!!!!!!
Absolutely brilliant, Banger
@pagansforbreakfast good one ☺
48 here. Rave culture in the 90s was unbeatable.
40 here
Same feeling bro
I’m only 13 I wouldn’t of found this song if it wasn’t for my dad
Same :)
I'm 56 lol
Imagine how Tiesto feels lol
Ironically I'm 18 and listening to this tune!
Jamie Guppy 48......✨
54 old me, agrees totally on the ageless maqic
I know right , I'm 38 and remember my old rave day's in early 2000s . Potent memories.
Never too old.
im 17 :D
36 here not one fuck given 🤘
Same here buddy. You can race with this track somewhere...
I am 20 right now btw
I am going back to my childhood! My brother always listened this and now I am a trance addict!
Tomasz Drewniaczyk Im. 33 bro I totally understand ur Feeling I have Bern to his concert the old tiesto is. Not with us anymore
Same here 37
@Im Chipp Nope. I'm old. Lol
@mephistopheles thanks , but i skate Everyday day do you dont have to Worry about my phone :)
​@Im Chipp One thing you'll notice in all of these is NO CELL PHONES. Everyone enjoyed everyone and the environment. If you ever really, truly want to enjoy a show, leave your damn phone in your car. Everyone thinks they need to record everything, but that's a lie. Every rave I ever attended is burned into my brain. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9L-U-hg8x4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQYn3YGLod0 <-- Tiesto's peak (IMO) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5dT8L6_Pz8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZT9mOcy74 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Tw1ys7AL0 <- Classic Armin is my all time favorite DJ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ca7ddgddtI&t=4022s <-- Older/newer stuff, but all amazing vocals. This is the "close your eyes and feel emotions" music. AAaaaannnnyywho. If you want some more choice stuff to listen to, dig deeper into the artists in the lists that you find interesting. Enjoy.
46 and still loving it!
39 here, and same
I'm 45 and I still love it
If I live to 90+ and my hearing still working I will still like this music.
Sad life bro, no offense
I guess real trance will live forever! ...........just like me lol!
52years old and I still feel like I'm 18 listen to this tune!!
I'm 53 and I don't know but I can't believe we are in 2019 and this music still ahead of its time...
Duude im 15 and digs this
Jamie Guppy I’m go n 53
Legend
even worse: I am 43)))
Same here

If I hear well, this song was inspired by &quot;Samuel Barber - Agnus Dei&quot;? <a href="https://youtu.be/AiuC_CaObbI">https://youtu.be/AiuC_CaObbI</a>
very obsolete
wooow ahr 2019???

@Nurul Liyana que pasa?
진짜 내가 좋아하는
Then, now &amp; forever
Saw him live in June 2000 in Amsterdam and I’ve never looked back.

Si escuchando esto no te has comido un morti no sabes de fiesta

the ecstasy flash back my body gets when i listen to this yaaass i love it!!!!!!
Jawbreaking
Miss this Tiesto
Szkolna 17 Uniwersum!
I think Samuel Barber would like this version of his music
Es q hace mucho q no salgo
Esto es la ostia
Mozna sluchac kazdej muzyki i lubic wszystko od Disco Polo po szeroko pojeta muzyke elektroniczna pod szyldem EDM ale zawsze mam ciarki jak slucham dobrego Hardstyle&#39;u czy takiego klasycznego Trance&#39;u ( upliftingu, progressive trance&#39;u, vocal trance&#39;u itp) &lt;3
How many people listening to this has Kevin and Perry to thank??

@GgGgG gGgG no problem, its always nice when someone can help you find that song you cant find yourself.
@Devin Graves thank you very much. Ive been looking for it for years and years
@GgGgG gGgG its Adagio for Strings by Barber. I like the Detroit Symphony recording.
whats the original?
We need an Updated clear audio so i can bass in mah town like a normal person dahh
yes good track. does anyone know who made this track for tiesto...? it was not tiesto itself. this comes from finland. funny at this share guy he is not adsense member to show any commercials.... funny. sorry about me but propably tiesto itself can tell about me better as a music producer...
Tiësto when music rained notes not money...

No hay nadie q m entienda?
Our orchestra played the original during our last concert. Of course, I wasn&#39;t part of it because I play oboe. It was beautiful because I got to take a break.

Nothing like to be always nothing, nothingness is the best and safest situation ever, I believe if that we had nothing from the beginning is much better than having something and losing it, nothing worse than losing, nothing like being always safe. 💔
Who from 2020?

This song is my chilldhood. Never get&#39;s old.
@LH123 How old are you?
Aistis Records I was so young when my mum played it on her stereo. I remember jumping on her bed to it 😂. It was played on a throwback radio station pretty sure it was on KISS, and instantly I remembered it so technically I never forgot it 😄
@LH123 How can you forgot about it? It's unforgettable.
I forgot about it. Then the radio was playing throwbacks and this came on and my God it opened doors I totally forgot I locked 11 years ago!

April 2019.....
This is my childhood song! Never gets old to me.
Hasta hace muy poco descubrí que este mix está inspirada en la pieza clásica <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23adagio">#adagio</a> como siempre tiesto desde sus inicios has sido un maestro en la música electrónica 😊
No está inspirada, es la pieza de Samuel barber pero en versión Trance.
Hola vuelvo del pasado y si estoy contra tu opinión de la música eléctronica, es mi pasión tengo 11 años y mi sueño es ser dj. Si pregu tas por el el nombre de maría es por que estoy en el teléfono de mi abuelita :p

La mejor canción de la historia....historia.....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Recuerdos de Vietnam 😐
Una de las mejores, sin duda alguna.
His old trance songs are legendary, however many old trance artists have drifted towards techno and it saddens me but every now and then I come back to this song and smile.
Mam po 40 stce .... słucham !!!!

Hello from summoners rift
What a tune bring me back to my teens going to the discos partying mad and still going yupzz...👍👍👍😊😊😊🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
I personally do not care what Tiesto has done with his career as of now, i fully respect his mainstream transition, i will always respect him as he is one of the Pioneers alongside PVD, Ferry Corsten, AVB, A&amp;B, of the wonderful Trance community we had in the 90&#39;s - early 2000&#39;s.<br><br><br> I am not a gatekeeper and let anyone listen to what they like, but THIS, you must admit is fucking Heaven on earth.<br><br><br> Much respect to this legend and all other pioneers of Trance.

😭😭😭 es muy triste😩😭😭
Absoluter Trance Klassiker😍
Олды здесь?
Samuel Barber - Agnus Dei is the original song if someone wondered.
And Tiesto would probably never had done this if it wasn't for William Orbits version...
The original version is called adagio for strings (1936) Agnus Dei is a later version by the same composer.

2019 anyone?)
Apparently Tiesto didn&#39;t produce this track. it was his ghost producer Dennis Waakop Reijers, and he created most of the famous tracks for Tiesto.

Great track by Dennis Waakop Reijers... Tiesto barely made any of these tracks himself, yet Dennis barely gets credited... Look it up if you think I&#39;m wrong
Это как произведение Бетховена или Моцарта ,такая музыка будет жить вечно.

Permanent shivers and goosebumps? Anyone? ANYONEEEE?????????
I'm crying
@Erich Thompson Dude, I've only needed 2-3 sec to recognize the song ... goosebumps all the way to the end! Fck me, I'm 36 and I still remember this as I was young (early 20's)
What drugs were you taking when you made all those replies dude?

ORIGINAL Tiesto !!!!! ..... today just a name.. im so sad.. :(
Absolute tune I remember back in the days of happiness
2025?
Ciaryy do końca życia....
Rest in eternal PEACE brother. Nobody else like Tiesto, never will and never has. You now set the rhythm and the beat throughout heaven. 🎚🔆
Wtf Tiesto isn’t dead bro.
2019
tiesto is my uncle
Anyone from 2020 still here?
2019 &lt;3
Wow i like it
Shame.
Geez, what &quot;EDM&quot; has done to electronic music. =( Can tell the difference in real talent &lt;3 miss old Tiesto.
Spettacolare. ❤️
Tiesto is like God.
still goes off at creamfields when he headlines a set and drops this. lucky enough to witness 2017 creamfields.
When Tiesto was God of Trance !! Nowadays... It&#39;s all faded in the dark...
Still was sick in it's day
Adajio for Dj Tjesto to burn in fucking hell for killing Avicii. 👎
It&#39;s sad, because it&#39;s no. 1 after looking for &quot;Adagio for strings&quot; in YouTube search engine. So ashamed... No. 1? Oh, God, is it the end of the world?
I’m catching a beer on the doorstep of my house in Brooklyn listening to this MARCH 2019
Am I in the British comment section?

@Kidy Fiddler careful not to catch cancer from those fucking emojis m8
@Kidy Fiddler is there somethinv wrong in your life considering how you are envious of everyone?
why would i care about the march part
Saw this live a few years ago
Build it up..... so goood
نایس
This is REAL Tiesto. Tracks like this never die.
This îs Number one dj in the WORLD the king of trance music This îs oldschool masterpice of trance
Tiesto was a stud when he made this but now he married and it got him all wack but he still my fav of all time.
Tiesto forever
So True
Paul Murphy - wow. I retract my previous comment. Never realised. Seems like Tiestos name has been used as a money making scheme. A bit gutted because growing up I loved all his stuff and bought all the albums. Atleast I have the memories.
@r3v1v0 William orbit already did it in 1990s
And it's not even his,Samuel barber William orbit
I am all techno, but sometimes I come back to my roots where it all started for me for electronic music..
Legend
Thank you Samuel Barber !! tracks like Adagio for stings never die ...Even when they are butchered :)
Just one!!!
Слажем се Лазаре. Поздравите Вашу маму.
he was was and still is fake its all done by peeps who are never get credit,,,he just stands there rakin in money,,,,,,,,,,never liked him never will, but enjoy the music- thats not his
Agrees with the comments here....when I played this track at 1:00 a,m, my neighbor in the next town filed a formal complaint with the Authorities about my LOUD music...so I play it at 2:00 a.m. Problem solved!
Samuel barber is obviously the main genius behind this but I would say the vision tiesto had to turn this into the trance song that he did was also quite impressive. I wish he still stuck to trance. Songs like urban train were ideal also.
Yup. I agree.
Hey hes a legendary Dj
Trance Tiesto was the best Tiesto
I doubt it. They probably think Barber is some dude collabing with Tiesto. Lol.
❤️❤️❤️
Samuel Barber.
Hope you guys know this music is just the remix of the same name by Samuel Barber.
This never die! 2029
goldenDropBear he completely forgot his fans
Lazar Bojcic that’s right we never die ♊️♓️👍
It's felt like he has left trance for good😞,hopefully he brings it back at some point,in the mainstream he is just another overhyped dj making R&B dance mixes,in trance he was a God.
Forever.
Just be!
is true!

Just for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a>
and much honor goes also to Samuel Barber - Adagio for Strings
Of course- a master himself!!! X.
Yup. And ferry corsten for having the vision to remix the original first

Anyone know where that overlay sample comes from at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=5m57s">5:57</a> please? I&#39;m a big techno head and it&#39;s giving me flashbacks galore...
My 1st ever show i djayd, i dedicated this to my dad who had passed away and was in Vietnam. Thank you TIESTO!!!!! G.O.A T.!!!!
.
This is great, but it&#39;s somewhat of a shame that this has more views than the original. Still a banger though.

TIESTO GOD VAO SE FIFEP SEUIS &lt;:&quot;LS
March 5, 2019. Tiesto - forever, the legend, the one...never get old, the real classic. The true #1 DJ in the world. Armin is the only one who can truly compete with him and it is only to you to decide who is the best.

So sad to see that nobody mentioned Samuel Barber, the original composer of this music. Tiesto is a talented DJ but should have given more credits to Barber. This is not 100% his original work.
@Toxicin2 Samuel Barber adagio for strings .it's the same name X)
Which song of him is it?
@Rolly-E Samuel Barber is the creator of the epic original version ;) , the version of tiesto its nothing without the epic original version
who tf cares about samuel barber, when tiesto made history
Love me trance
Sалют!!)))

Seyx 123 huh like it really means something have you prepared a coffin out of despondency? Things are there lots of modern underground artist to be reckoned with I guess you’ve forgotten when the track was issued it deemed as too modern by the lovers of long by gone flairs
Arthur Stein-Tarnowski I mean the new school, my friend. Regards.
Armin Van Buuren shivers CosmicGate te wave Exploration space that was music
You decided for everyone ? Pathetic statement from the petty looking attention individual

Are there any rave /trance heads left i feel like the scene has died down or what? this thump hard off the bass
Nice
THIS MUSIC IS MY DRUG ☻😈👺🤯🤪
If a trance tune ever wants to be called ‘the best ever,’ this is the tune it has to top! This is the epitome of what a trance track is all about: the build up; the moments of silence; the treble; the base; THE DROP!!!!
Ktoś 2579 słucha ?

You completely destroy the most beautiful music from 20 century. This particular style of music was reflecting on the Vietnam War and all wars. How dare you, how dare you!! You call yourself an artist, to me you are hack who does not care about music or the impact that it has on human soul. You are complete Jack Ass.
👈🏼 🎧 👉🏼
Up there with &#39;Energy 52 - Café Del Mar&#39;, &#39;System F - Out of the Blue&#39; and &#39;Yomanda - Sunshine&#39; as some of the all time best Trance!
This song will never get old
Adiago For Strings - Lucas &amp; Steve is much better
If someone asks you what trance music is, shown them this Tiesto masterpiece.
2k19 &amp; and people still like TIESTO.!!!

The first time I heard this I had chills down my spine. A million years later still there!
Kiedyś to byly piosenki a Teraz to jakby ktoś jeździł piła mechaniczna po kaloryferze
The Ferry Corsten Remix was much better, but this isn&#39;t too bad.

dandypajamas This song will be forever and ever cool as fuck.
Wait, this was released on the day I was born
2004
Just to let you know, tiesto first made this in 2003..
ALWAYS LOVED ORIGINAL ADAGIO from galipoli AND THIS IS EVEN BETTER.
The song still gives me goosebumps the music ive just loved it
MELHOR MUSICA DELE
Was working near breda n watched him do live set near the archies brilliant nite
hi
This song remember me one of my various lonely travel&#39;s that I did in 2009 . I&#39;m almost can see the same sky with stars and the grass passing all long the highway, while I was watching this passing through the landscape I was imagining where I&#39;m going to be in the future. So , here I am, 10 years looking back and feeling this nostalgic atmosphere. Sometimes I imagine if I could back in the past not to change things, but just to fell all this moments again.
I think my neighbour played this song...
Need a music festival with this kind of music, not the actual bullshit, just artist like tiesto, Gigi...
byGiNeSiToX new tiesto is not an artist. Sorry

Shit would be intense if I had my system on full in my apartment 2x the speaker in pic which is 15&quot; pa speakers and an 18&quot; active subwoofer connected by the slave option on my amplifier which for you who don&#39;t know only puts signal thru and not power so is safe for active speakers and subwoofers it&#39;s a amplifier which is no longer built and I&#39;ve only been able to find two more which where auctioned 😀

THANK YOU TIESTO.MWA MWA
Picked up theme song from one of the best war movies ever made - Platoon (1986). <br>But a masterpiece track though. 👏
https://youtu.be/kRCubAtPiKg heres the original song, and the movie was made in 1986.
@Tauriq Abdullah the original melodie is from Hans Zimmer, soundtrack from the movie Platoon. Then, there were hundreds of remixes. Tiestos' is just one of them and got most popular. Its amazing song from tiesto. I was just talking about original melodie which is from a master himself:)
Ferry corsten remixed it first. Tiesto got the idea from him. I think the original is called barber's adagio for strings.
Imagine what it’s like at the corncerts I’ve been to one of his it’s FLIPPIN hype as hell

I must be careful, because hearing such piece of trance in my car tend to cause explosion of power in my veins........&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>On the other hand, at my workout place I&#39;m not listening to anything else... and these are the days I am breaking through my physical limits; so it is, in fact, fine. Thanks anyway.

@Sk8 Academy Oxia - Domino (Morten Granau Remix)
@Sk8 Academy listen to ecstasy - morten granau remix, and l'amour toujours. if you liked the first one you like hardtrance/psytrance, and if you liked the second you like trance
@Sk8 Academypsytrance is the keyword you're looking for!
@Sk8 Academy absolutely there is. "Trance" is the genre. Tiesto id practically a godfather of the electro-trance culture.
This in the best trance or electronic shit i ever heard, tell me if theres more like this!

If i had to explain the feeling this song gives me, it&#39;s like being at a concert and it&#39;s around 6 or 7 am and the party will be over soon and the ecstasy effects have almost passed away and this dream like state will soon be over, but it&#39;s okay, everything is going to be okay &lt;3

Goodbye is what’s said When you say adieu To the the first you throw in To a trap made for two
Orchids are rare And come in white If you find a black orchid Its purple In really bright light
In heaven its said When you go for a poo In the ‘slegs blanks’ toilets They play tiesto

January 2019 :)
Here
@Maserati7200 i see what u mean with the up votes. People are always desparate for attention. Ik that this wasnt originally a meme but since people spam it so much its forced to be a meme. Kinda like bird box memes, no one thinks there funny( i hope so) but people still make them cause they want to fit in
new years eve 2018
XxShadowEclipsexX that’s weird, memes are usually funny. All these are repetitive and annoying. It’s not a meme. It’s you guys wanting easy upvotes and realizing this a low effort thing that works. And lol, projection much? I’m someone who sits inside all day on a screen because I’m pissed off at seeing the same stupid comment over and over again? Maybe it’s the people who spam every music video with the same comment who have no life. Ever think about that? It’s not deep dude. It’s people wanting attention and approval from others. So they write the same comment all over the place knowing it’ll get upvotes.
@Maserati7200 the world needs peace. Not disappointments that have no social life and sit behind a screen all day and make fun of people like yourself
@Maserati7200 but then again saying that bathing in acid would be too nice of a punishment was pretty fuckin cruel so what does it matter
@Maserati7200i do admit me asking who disowned you was kinda rude
@Maserati7200the reason everyone comments that is because its a meme. there not toxic for playing along with cultures trends. Me and you are both guilty of following trends(if u dont live under a rock) the reason i called you toxic was because of how violently u lashed out on a guy that was just trying to be funny
XxShadowEclipsexX you’re the toxic ones. Why do i have to see this same comment on every music video? Do you people have any original thoughts whatsoever?
@Maserati7200 who disowned you? Yikes your toxic. :I
Here. From finland
A Happy 2019 for everyone.
@Maserati7200 toxic af....
Still...sick!!!

When I hear this I get flashbacks from Black Lagoon Anime
BEST DJ EVER!!
November 2018 ✋
good to know that the music written agnus dei(lamb of god aka jesus) would be used for kids to listen to on drugs.
aka it's written by samuel barber. He'd roll over in his grave if he found out
very very good can u send me extacy song?
Pour info si quelqu&#39;un vient critiquer les commentaires que j&#39;ai mit je suis le directeur du meilleur festival au monde donc si vous voulez faire un set au prochain festival attention au critique que je vais recevoir !!
Ce n&#39;est pas dj Tiesto c&#39;est Tiesto tout cours vous fete vraiment pas partie du monde électro ptn
TUNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!
The best fact about that song that it&#39;s actually christian&#39;s Agnus Dei, composed by Samuel Barber. Tiesto with love to all Christians :)
יפה. מאד
fucking trashworld garbage
Invulnerable.<br><br>I just realized why Tiesto was the best; because at incredible bpm levels, he had the best beats... This song is quite fast, I mean really, it is even above Trance standarts, but it still sounds perfect, still best...
ElectronX music how do you know that ?
It's ghost produced. Tiesto payed someone to make this.
The best part is that he kept that melancholic and ominous feeling of the original and gave it a little twist.
Megustan esa cansion eleronica
Weird to to think my mum and dad took pills in the 90s and danced fo this. An im here like i missed the 90s fuck you
Listening to this song in 2018 ....from Algeria 🙋🤗💞

SZP
Still crank this sucker up when off tap😎🤟🤟🤟🤟
Crazy how music with no words can make you feel so much. In this case, remember so much. This is nostalgic, tiesto was the shit back in the day!
@MRNX Like so many artists nowadays... so sad.
@Jim Lahey he doesnt make his own music anymore man
the liar king no one said he produced it. But it is well known and remembered because of him..
it wasnt tiestos shit, someone else wrote and performed it, tiesto just stuck a record on. if you think tiesto produced this you must be thick.
A mi también :v
@E Same here. That jackie chan song pisses me the fuck off tho.
@Jim Lahey I'm not even part of the generation that used to listen to this but I think it's actually hella good
@Darren Nagiah with jackie chaaaaaaaaannnnn ;P
Still the shit ....
Yeah dont listen to tiesto now... It aint worth it.

Jebac system
👍👍
DJ Tiesto brought amazing music to all throughout the 90’s and today. He knew what sounds penetrated our blood and soul that opened out concession and our eyes lit up our bodies shook and we knew music that Tiesto created made something that no words can explain. Thank You Tiesto for the incredible music you gave to all wha a gift 🎁
Amaizing song !! i love this shit !!! yeahh
My favorite piece of music period. Lets not forget the composer is Samuel Barber. Tiesto took an awesome composition to a new level.

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=2m03s">2:03</a> Me when I wake up and look at my dogs in the eyes sitting patiently by the kitchen wagging their tails and realize I didn&#39;t buy their dog food in time yesterday, then they bust out glow sticks and glow in the dark hoolahoops bouncing around on their hind legs, shaking their butts and throwing their paws in the air
I remember I was 17 when this came out and I have the absolute best memories with many great friends to this track. Feel lucky I got to experience things like this in life. 😎
😲😲😲🏃🏼‍♂️🎧
This song just does not grow old, unlike me...

Космос,огонь,бомба!
It’s 3022, 700 years post-apocalypse, humanity has ended, artificial intelligence took over. Humanoids are roaming the red sandy hills of what was once New York rediscovering the human civilisation. One robot, X01739B finds an odd circular item hidden 5 meters under the sand. He analyses it, music comes out of it. The music was so beautiful that it created a glitch in the machine, X01739B is suddenly struck by an odd current. That’s how he started having feelings. He then sends the rhythm to the Central Processor and then .............

I miss music testo
Is there any remix of this part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=3m44s">3:44</a> on Youtube? It&#39;s my favourite and I would like to have a longer version of it.<br><br>Btw: I dont want original version. I love this tiesto&#39;s
William orbit version
The original song of 3:44 is "adagio for strings" or "Agnus Dei" from Barber
Thanks guys 😃👍
Ganz großes Kino!!!
No thank you. It is not something that you can alter or fake. It is that way with any masterpiece. There is only one and it is a gift from God.
still amazing in 2018 !
great job!

Hello everyone. I would just like to tell you that this is not only my favorite song in the genre of trance, but the best song in EDM&#39;s history. <br>I first heard this song when I was 10, when my dad (who is a big fan of the genre) decided to show me this song. I heard it, and then, I just fell out of reality and into this random world (not literally, just metaphorically). After hearing this song, I remember saying this: &quot;Is this the only song that sounds like this?&quot; <br>Then I started really liking this style. I became a big fan of Tiësto&#39;s music. Then I became a big fan of other people who produced the same type of music. <br>A few years later, I forgot about this songs&#39; existence, and the melody was only muffled <br>However I then remembered the name 8 years ago. I came back and listened to it, and I fell into that state that I had years earlier. <br>Thanks Tiësto. Without you, I wouldn&#39;t be with this genre for so long <br>-Belgian Waffle
My fucking god. There is no feeling bigger than this. As a producer among many producers. Theren is nothing that tells you you are out of your element when it comes to this tune. It truly slaiughters all emotions. This too powerful. It is too strong. It is.... Beautiful...... Tiesto. You will be a god forever for this. For..... Fucking...... Ever.......
@A_Star Yeah you are so unfortunately right :(
unfortunately he turned to shitty pop/generic house music. he is no longer the good tiesto. :(

i just listened once in my mp3 when i was 6 or 7 years old and then forgot it until now.... perfect... reminds me the old days...
Can someone recommend me more songs like these?
Anything by Simon O Shine. Type in “The Last Goodbye Simon O Shine” will make you cry x
Just listen to Paul van Dyke, Sasha, Tall Paul, Trade or any other DJ from 92-98

I am so proud that I was born in the right generation to listen to this, and not like these kids today &lt;3<br><br>Edit: Anyone 2019 here? :3<br><br>Edit v2.0: Holy shit almost 400 likes thanks guys. &lt;3
poor guys that have to be born in the generation whose musical achievement they can solely approve...
Im 14 and i love this music
not me does anyone else like this song i hate it but i like it cuz its a really good song!
2003 here, so dont say nonsense.
what
Lmao why would you compare a song to memes?
Actually stfu about being born in the right generation, cant i enjoy it now seriously.
Generation x more like generation sux
97' to about 2002 was an amazing experience with this music
2019:1"

You will forget everything when you will die
WISH YOU WERE NEVER BORN
Leon same dude
you arent special be real these days real music is still being made but just not mainstream (this wasnt mainstream either except in holland) and we can still listen to this music like you see this generation has it easier tbh they can find any type of music that they like with no problem and you arent instantly special because you were born in the 90s there are still festivals dedicated to old school trance so we aint missing out on everything
Grew up to this,
I’m 37 and I prefer to listen to lil pumps musical masterpieces and sonatas than this garbage static
Also id like to say chart music is beyond the artists control they're basically puppets and most get fucked over by record labels
@Thomas Corcoran not all kids are the same and hip hop baggy clothes hmm I rarely see that shit I'm 21 now like but always listen to older stuff as it was better but it's not the genres that have changed there are still many great EDM artists covering all electronic genres and sub-genres matey
I was born in 2005 😐
@Slayer Of heretics I guess Tiesto didnt turn out to be a fad after all.
Shane Van Mosseveld generation strange!
@Milo02 same 😥
I'm one of those ppl today, but I hate all the new trends like fortnite and juuling, I love this song and wish I was born in that generation...
and i am sad i wasn't born when these hits were playing :(
trance, hardstyle, hardcore nothing like the rave but only good music
Everyone was born in the "right" generation. It was his generation. I can not hear this "then music was still music" anymore. I grew up in the 60s. And I still hear current music today - if it's good.
yas
The kids today can still listen to it y'know. Just way more easily
2019!
I'm 14, but I prefer listening to goldies like adagio for strings not shitty drug hip hop
I'm 2019 next birthday ut still bangin it
Present and acounted for
I'm 16. I'm not today's crap. I. AM. *OLDSCHOOL.*

Iam 16 but i love this more then some memes or fucking rap... This is one of the best songs
YouTube was all fields in my day
Come to Northern Ireland and you will see what us kids listen to then
@Harry No.
2004 here, bitch. Go brag about how the past generation was better in anyway as many time as you want. This kind of people will never let younger generation to hear the gold
Damn kids!!! With their baggy jeans and boomity music boxes and their hippity hop music! (Shakes cane at neighborhood kids).

Santiago de chile disfruta de la buena musica
para mi es y sera la mejor cancion de tiesto en la historia
Prefiero adagio
Será de él cuando componga algo... Es del compositor Samuel Barber
Es de barber en realidad ... es solo un cover de tiesto
Asi lo creo
In my memory (Gabriel & Dresden) se lleva ese premio...
El mejor
Martin pero sin pedos queda en el top 5
La.verdad que muy dificil elejir

Viva tiesto
Played a mixed version of this Friday night at a 18 year olds party, they pretty much all stood there like what&#39;s this when it was coming in, I built them up then let them have it both barrels, needless to say it went down incredibly with a room full of bladdered 18 year olds, they loved it and wanted me to play more of that music lol, it was the end of the night for me at this point now though as the parents had only paid me up until a certain point, I couldn&#39;t however let trance die again that night so I stayed for an extra 2 hours free, I played everything from that point on from Vera Cocha to Vincent de moor, you name it I dropped it, it was a boring night though really up until the Tiesto point and then it turned out to be a night I will never forget, Ive since had 6 bookings all from people that was there, now to all the youngsters out there who may read this, remember just because we are not 18 it doesn&#39;t mean we are old or don&#39;t no how to party, it just means you don&#39;t no what a party is ! Us &quot; old dogs &quot; from the trance days are not deluded/dead or living with our eyes shut, we are simply just waiting for the right moment to open yours !
Greatings form slovenia, this will always be one of the best songs
This is beter than despacito
Everything is better than despacito
@Arlex P. Franco someone show this person out! 😉
you spelt "Completely F#&king Awesome!" wrong 😎
well ummmm obviously
Bruv, literally anything is better than Despacito
@Bacsa Illes Oliver It would be a funny idea
Can we get a despacito remix of this song thanks
@Arlex P. Franco Are you trolling? A fukin' crap with the same beat, drums etc. and awful lyrics is better than emotional and beautiful banger?
Also a better love story than twilight.
@OhTheyAteMyCat r u kidding me? despacito is better :D
Don't even compare this to that disgrace of a song.

its sad that he never plays this song ever again on his tours around the world and etc.. Only plays the newly songs and its really sad, imagine if this song would play how the crowd would react. Only true tiesto fans know what i mean by this. One of his best songs i think.

Mano do céu :OOO procuro essa música a anos, n acredito ter achado kkkkk comecei a gostar de eletrônica por conta dela na época tinha 9 anos.
@COMO FAZER todo som do tiesto no inicio dos anos 2000 é foda
Chorei emocionado slc, hj em dia n tem mais música foda assim ou eu n consigo encontrar.
Role another fat one Dave 😋😜

Tengo en mi mente esta canción.
Remember when this was trance?
Who’s here from 10+ years ago?
COOL!!! AHUENNO!!!!
This music always get me depressed, I dont know why...
@Panda Pandsky how about accept that you're wrong, its in b flat minor
@Adam Mackey ---my gush! Yes Aram ur right bro😁 this kind of music is meant to be listened w headphones!😂🤣😅😍
Levente popovics--- mmm sorry to hear that my dear, but it shouldn't depresses u since Tiesto music is awesome, hopefully u get used to it because u gonna love it😁 greetings from California!😘🤩
@Trident Remixes lets agree to disagree
@Panda Pandsky 1. It's in B flat minor. 2. Just because a song is in minor doesnt mean it will always sound "melancholic"
Levente Popovics idk if I get depressed or what but this feeling I love it makes me tear up and feel the music
Cos you ain’t listening with headphones;)
iirc it is in G minor so it will always sound melancholic :)
Maybe because it reminds you of Samuel Barber's version (the original song) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izQsgE0L450
Is ok.

@Ali Jackie Chan is shite. Take it ur not European mate cos Trance is massive here still.
@Dicky Mapster Do you think there is still a big enough market for his old music?
Honestly i enjoy his progressive house tracks but everything else he has been putting out has been hot garbage
I didn't mind some what later Tiësto with tracks like ''Chasing Summer'' or ''Pair of Dice'' Now it's actual forgettable pop.
Jackie Chan is nice, but this is so much better. Unfortunately trance has never been that popular in pop music which, so from a business point of view it's not smart to just do trance.
He's only staying relevant, if he doesn't go with the trends he won't be as popular anymore, almost everyone does it that's how they stay relevant my friend.
Trance is dead now and commercial music ate all of this soul back to the time when Trance &Techno and other 00s dance sounds was on the top
each year kinda has a certain sound before 2010 now it has nothing that really inspires a generation. Mine was dance music 90s 00s clubs closing down really screwed it all up in the uk.  They are turning them into houses or bars
What do you mean fallen...it's one of the most popular songs of the year he's laughing at this comment while he watches his bank account grow
Oh this is a masterpiece in comparison to the amount of shit we've been getting nowadays
BroI〈 en drum Machine he’s a sell out has no passion anymore you can tell that by the music he’s making
MrTrashCompaktor  For me the best version still is William orbit - Barber's Adagio for Strings Ferry Corsten Remix' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4opHv2BG4fY I never liked Tiesto's version at all, but music is a personal thing.
fhd
That shit that they call Jackie chan has almost got 64 million views what a pile of shit😂💯
Rich Mapstone  America wasn't completely guilty as House and techno have there origins in America but you would be right with European genres like Dubstep and Trance, plus The taste changes and sadly the people who enjoy this kind of music including me are the minority and majority are people who listen to the mainstream things.
Exactly this Jackie chan shit is a load of ballicks bring back the tiesto from the good old day's adagio for strings traffic get rid of the 20 year old girl haha u deserve a real woman haha who knows u
Come Back Old TIËSTO!!!!
Zaklamp no one here is complaining about "this generations" music. Take a look at my channel, I still upload mixes that are from artists and producers today. What we are saying is that Tiesto's music is shit now compared to what he became famous for producing. But nice try.
Might surprise you but that's also what the generation before your generation said about this music
His set at Tomorrowland was terrible. Above and Beyond however played a decent trance set that had the crowd going nuts. They have both been in the game for as long as each other. Tiesto sold out while others still produce music for the love of producing music. Tiesto now has a day job, not a passion. I'm not going to blow smoke up someones ass if the music they produce is shite.
Tiesto lost the plot as soon as EDM came a big thing in America. I don't blame the guy people have different ideas about success/money but his music changed from cult/underground classics to mainstream meh very quickly. Same with Armin. I still love them both from the joy there early stuff brings but I can't really blame them for wanting to ride the wave/stay current etc (however much it hurts)
@jeff Which is the best version? genuine question...
thisw is not the best version nut at least the try!
huh? tiesto must be glad his music others play!!!!
Tiesto on stage is not even tiesto anymore.. No happiness and pure enjoyment of set in sight when hes playing. Was in Untold last week and have to say we left after 30 minutes cause it was just pure garbage what he played.. Only mainstream and NOT a single of hes own masterpieces which he known for, just jackie chan and others which are not even danceable.. Never going listen tiesto again in concerts/festivals which coming up future.Just MY opinions don't take fans this seriously..
When I turn on the radio I feel like kicking his ass Jackie CHaaaaan
It is called "going with the flow". People these days only listen to garbage music, if you wanna fit in you need to make the same music.
BroI〈 en drum Machine you are right
You are so right

THATS THE ONLY WAY
LOL so a big gang of head bangers to this nice sound! Loved it!!!
@Greatomeister Oof
@Greatomeister LOL
My neigbours loved it so much they said I should write original jokes, not stolen jokes.
Haha aye mine to 50 times
hope they came at night so they would make a lightshow
One day I came home, opened my computer and looked up EDM. This song came up. I have been listening to trance since that day. I was 15, now I&#39;m 22.
@Mark Jones brilliant reply, Not that I'm trying to cause any trouble between you and that other person " but " you can't argue that your right.
@Gary Fletcher gvhuh
Ay I started listening to edm in 2011 when I was 14 that's right
Trance is timeless.
Shahin Shahsavari ...... try ....... Hardstylez Now !......
@Vikram Hooli lol keep telling yourself that. music is now better than it ever was. you need to get your head out of your arse.
@Trident Remixes Wrong again Trance is Trance. Stop feeding yourself American Pop Cultural terms. No one called it EDM back in those days. That EDM term started around (2008-2010) in North America so the American Music Industry could add House, Trance, Techno together inspired by vocal trance (vocal trance is a billion times better than American EDM), weak four four electro house beats with the atmosphere of Techno. Which EDM it started with dance-pop Lady Gaga went to that fake trancey-house tracks they called it (progressive house am I right?), Dubstep (Ear Cancer) developed to big room house the biggest calamity to music as a whole then future bass lmao. Actually the real progressive house in the 90's was brilliant. And now hip-hop in the mainstream thanks to this nonsense. Whenever a genre of music in the mainstream it's a very bad time for it. Somehow this American EDM shit has found a good old South American style of music called trap and destroyed that also along with hip-hop. Until that dies out. The genres will survive (House, Trance, Techno, Breakbeat, Downtempo, Drum N Bass), the mix pop cultured genres will die in the arse (EDM)
No offence Sharin, they we're amazing days pal. You missed out but enjoy the music, everyone's got their own memories to this tune. Be safe
F*ck EDM, but then... this track 😍
@Dimswart yeah... back in the day. trance fits under edm
@Trident Remixes aaah you little summer child, probably you were born in 2000's cause we didnt call it EDM back in the days. It was very specifically called "trance" music.
@Vikram Hooli trance is EDM whether you like it or not. EDM isn't just pop either. Do your research.
Trance is a genre in itself. EDM is American Pop Music that DJ Tiesto now produces. Americans want to confuse the whole world EDM is generic pop music. This is a classical trance track. Before 2006 all the EDM fans of the 2010's called this music Techno because they didn't like it and since they listen to garbage American EDM pop garbage they don't understand or appeciate classical trance as it is amazing music instrumentally and production wise.
I'm 48 and still love this classic, when I was 22yrs old (personally) the greatest days of EDM,my two sons take the piss out of me because they think your too old for EDM," wrong " you're never too old to listen to good music, the music that brings everyone together, there was a quote by some individual who said "(don't cry because its over,smile because it happened) best quote I've seen for many years. If only I could turn back the clock,anyway I've been there seen it and done it,no more big nightclubs now (because I'm married) but that's life.

It&#39;s such a shame this has more views than William Orbits version. William Orbit is the best version and Tiësto comes nowhere near close to matching it.

I feel like part of this song is a sample of a song from a movie, maybe a war movie about Vietnam. Help me out friends, what is it from?
Your're right. Now I found it. Thanks my friend. I will admit I do like this song better.
probably from the movie ''Platoon''

I hate you
alguien que hable español, compas???
This remix is good just because the original music is a pure masterpiece of classical music.
Just google... Samuel Barber adagio strings should do I think
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adagio_for_Strings
If you'd like to play it, here's the sheet music.... https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/adagio-for-strings-violin-1-digital-sheet-music/19480313 If you'd like to listen to the original.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izQsgE0L450
Thanks a lot.
Samuel Barber ..Diagio for Strings. Its a classical piece of music.
Could somebody please tell me what the original piece for violin is?
dj is not a composer dj takes the works of others and tunes it to the mood of the crowd, dj selects plays and modiefies music, a composer writes new creations a dj may also be a composer, with such great amount of music wrriten today there is a need for somebody who have listened to great deal of it so he make great choices depending on the set and setting that is the dj.
It is still being debated here? haha
Vaker llossenwaket.pedamuzek vaket vajuou
Samuel Barber
Do You really think is just because of that ?
Sergio Pappalardo this is my funeral music...... banging
Ashmeed Mohammed true..it is samples from William Orbit's version as it was first released as a William Orbit Remix
to be fair, this isnt a sample of the original used as just a sound bite for a whole new creation. its the original, but according to tiesto.. the original is great, this is just his take on it. adaigo for strings, adagio for synth.
Sergio Pappalardo ferry costern's remix is also good..the most shitty remix is the mark sixma one
back in the day ... when DJs used vinyls
Tyesto. Lo mejor l. D. S

Tiesto góra
One of those few and rare songs , where its forbidden to skip after it starts playing. those are the songs that make the gods cry. those songs can only be produced by an real legend, its shapped your hearth years ago, but those memmories connected to those songs can never be replaced or sold.

True fans come out when he mixes this track at events
Agnus Dei (Adagio for strings) Samuel Barber versión original, y esta de Tiesto es espectacular con sus sonidos y efectos electrónica.
Uwielbiam mimo upływu lat 💋
A belter love it ❤
When there was only Nexus to make EDM LOL old vibes
Aim Assist I m not a tiestofan. I like this n the red lights only. N only THIS version! The short one is a couple of shit! Rest in peace Avici!
Wired like a chemical rocket at 3AM on a Tuesday morning chewing your face off! Destination right the f*** on one!Neighbours are like McDonald’s!! Their lovin it!
This hurts to listen to - either the throbbing, or the blatant plagiarism and perversion of one of the greatest masterpieces of all time.
Que tiempos musicotee !!!!
bnza mamacona peru es todo xlas huebas no se presento...
The build up to this track is amazing
First time hearing this song. Not going to lie, had my doubts at first when it was purely the beat.<br><br>However, when the Adagio comes in, subtle and muted, and then into the etherial, alien tones coming through in electronic pings...I believe Barber would have enjoyed such a different take on his original piece.
William Orbit&#39;s Original Version of &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; is better...
Rolonas! Only to remember nice music

YES-
Dank je Tiësto voor de mooiste tijd van m&#39;n leven onvergetelijk te maken.
On lives his songs as of today we lost one of the best r.i.p avicii
The Ages of Trance , has nothing to do with Avicii completeley other genre he made
Avicii was only five years old when this was released so I don't see how this can be 'one of his songs' .. inspired him maybe but you are very wrong to attribute this to him. This predated him by 20 years.
AVICII E SÅ SAKNAD!!!BÄSTA !!!
Heffernan 14 this is clearly avicii yeah good job
Stfu
Heffernan 14 avicii was ok and rest his soul and he was commercial gender, but he cant and never will be comapred to this and to the old trance....1990 - 2003 was the time of Trance...it was masterpiece...
Como viajo con esta musica
This song ís so good, it hurts
UN HIMNO REALMENTE
🔈🔉🔊🎶🎵
Meh. Not a fan. The bass and snare don&#39;t meld at all. Tiesto can do better than this crap.
♥ Hammer ♥

Klasyk jeden z liderów
Old good tiesto.
<a href="https://youtu.be/fN3xz1_BjSs">https://youtu.be/fN3xz1_BjSs</a> This is the same as Barber’s Adagio for Strings! It even says Adagio for Strings in parenthesis! It was used in the movie Platoon, but it’s BARBER’S composition ! It’s also his melody for Agnus Dei, which is a movement from a Catholic mass! Tiesto only uses the beginning melody phrases of that composition in this remix! 😊🎶

Muy buena mescla

What a tune!!!!!!
It&#39;s funny how people said: <br><br>&quot;Classic!!! Tiesto for ever!&quot; <br><br>When this song is just a remake of &quot;Barber&#39;s Adagio For String&quot; from William Orbit who is the Legend!
Memories...brings tears to my eyes I shit you not.
PLATOON
Man just listening to this makes me remember what it is that got me into music. A great song never to be forgotten.
Listening to this at 3 am sends you in an other and different world
2018
Just brilliant
Amazing song
i expected this to somewhat defile the original, but never that it would be just as good, only differently
FODA
Miss Tiesto, ATB, Paul Van Dyk....the true legends of Trance. Everyone else today just isn&#39;t the same.......
10 años después sigue siendo el mejor tema de Tiësto con mucha diferencia
MY EARS ARE BURNINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

I&#39;m back to this because a name of TIESTO
Still on in 2018
EkwaDorcia :-*
He just ruined the song
48yrs old but this is what you call real music, Not the shite these young ones have today, I think many listening will agree.
Damn I'm 21 and I would love to be able to travel back to the time when this was popular.. Gotta say there are some young artists that still are good tho
Gary Fletcher Agree 100 percent. 40 yrs old , I love to go out still but I can not have fun since what they play now days is a discrace ... horrible. Old school rules!
Trance, Eminem, Bomfunk MC's etc saved me from the backstreet boys in the late 90's
Dave young signorino
Bobby,I see your point,my dad is still listening to Patsy Cline stuff and he slags our generations music so it works both ways,OK I might have come across a bit harsh but i had no intention of causing a big fuss,just joking with what I said on my post, but at the same time I'm a outspoken person,anyway I'll give you the thumbs up on what you pointed out,oh! Only if your not a TORY voter(conservative) as them bastards don't live in the real world.
Gary Fletcher I do agree but we ain't them and they ain't us and once upon a time the ones before us were not us and they said the same about us Open Your Mind buddy
48 anaw m8....still day whit a wantay day...dees choons are our gen and i fuquin still luv em.....
Honestly I hate most music nowadays too. 50 percent of the time it's the 2 minute compressed soppy shit you get on the radio the other 50 percent of the time it's boring hip hop with like two layers in it but there are still some good artists out there that never get played on the radio you just have to do some digging around that's all.
better than its ever been??? when you build up and build up and then have a sick drop that only lasts for 20 seconds ??? gtfoh lol this is what real music is...
Gary Fletcher define real music
XD im 14 IM DIFFERENT OK
Dae real music is dead?!?! Fuck off, this song is what the young ones actually listened to.
Im almost 54 and stiil llove this music
so fucking true
100% spot on! Well said my friend. Oh ! And that's from a scouser.
THANKS,but I'm not that bad,even if I am a scouser .
Gary Fletcher 17 in two weeks n av been listening to stuff like this since a was shittin in nappy’s mate
Perhaps because they are replying to Gary Fletchers post who mentioned that he is 48? A wild guess :)
that's not true Dave
Gary Fletcher I was at Rotterdam when he played ... Dennis the menace capsules 💊💊"BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE "
I turned 50 last month folks...... And these kind of tunes take me back so hard..... It's like I'm at Monastery all over again!!!!! Search 'shock records'.... ;-)
your name sound like a typical serial killer
Listen to hardcore pussy’s
So true, i remember in my time everyone at school had their old nokias filled with tiesto,deadmau5's etc.. mp3 files! My 13yo sister is lucky that i showed her this kind of music, she prefers this over modern pop :)
Amen to that Seth Rohr, when this was released by Tiesto people were scanting it wasn't real music and how the they don't make real music anymore at that time. Now apparently this song is old enough and it belongs to the cat of real music? what a joke. Like you said, EDM these days is bloody amazing and better than it's ever been. I love listening to adagio for strings every now and then but current EDM is amazing as well. You just need to be open-minded and not only listen to what's played on radio/tv stations.
Seth Rohr Well said! I totally agree. There's no need to pigeonhole any particular genre of music as subpar or overrated! Nor is there any excuse for you to discriminate against any music based on how current it is! I'm in my early 40's & I can say without reservation that, just as much as there was bad shite that was released from way back when, there's good music that's out there now.
Lazaar this generation of music isn't shit, people just don't know how to look for any ones to their taste
They don't know they're born, We've been through the 60's ( part of ) 70's, 80's, 90's BEST TIME, 00's and still here, And like you said "we live to tell the story"
oh! god why all people are telling their respective age!
48 and still banging this out, My granddaughter loves this in the car.. TUUUNNNEEE
You can't generalise and say all the music nowadays is shit , there was a good music and there is a good music now and there will be a good music in the future
This type of thing happens every generation. I'm 16 and my parents don't like the "shit" I listen to and lecture me on how music was better when they were growing up and I agree some of it is. They spent their teenage life in the 90s and dance and trance music was their music. They had the same situation with their parents telling them that music was better in their day. The cycle continues and at the end of the day, music is music and if you like and it and it makes you feel good, listen to it, don't let anyone tell you not to. Sorry for a mini rant.
Y’all are dumb af and stuck in the past... there still is great music today, EDM is better than its ever been and besides that there is still great music in every genre. Great music will always be around u just have to find it
Connor Fazakerley all the old stuff you'll remember even when you get Alzheimer's, not like today's shite.
Gary Fletcher haha i love oldschool edm
Connor Fazakerley ,fuck me fazak,not that far from me,anyway well said lad,
Gary Fletcher 18 years old and I couldn’t agree more
Jo Palmer it's gone like the dinosaurs, ( EXTINCT )
Gary Fletcher where has all the good times gone
Kids nowadays don't listen to music unless the artists have tattoos covering their faces. Total scum generation
Lucas Lehner I'm pissing myself laughing, well said Lucas
I‘m 7000 years old and still listen to that.
Alex Müller that would be like trying to teach a old dog new tricks Alex!
teach the young bloods how its done !
Gary Fletcher xD
I am 15 and i agree, also hate shite.
ethan keenan well said Ethan,these young one's must envy us lot because we had the days of real music,real music stays in your head the shite they throw out now goes in one ear and out the other
Gary Fletcher 15 and im glade i dont liten to the shite today better than any thing

Gary Fletcher If you think it you are it is has been said by many psychologists. keep listening to heavenly music like this. This song was played at my grandpa's funeral this is my cry song i always think of the fond memories of my grandpa during this song.
Johann S lol best comment ever!!😂😂

Haha lol
Andre, I have just celebrated my 70th birthday and this is one of my favourite old style types of Trance/Ibiza music along with Agnelli & Nelson, Darude and Avicci etc. etc. just cannot go wrong- LOVE IT!.
Thank you for the reminder
Johann S i must be your neighbour
you made me turn it upp lol :D
Thee worse hooligans are Russian polish and Serbian these days.
would you be my neighbor?
Gary Fletcher the english have done that as well just utube it to show your hypocrisy
greg glover yes roma fans were a disgrace but its no different to the english hooligans who also commit disgusting acts in fact the english are the worst as everywhere the english go there is trouble and you can't deny it as its a weekly basis.
We dont age , only body ages. We are eternal (realized on LSD, confirmed by scriptures)
Who wouldn't want to listen to this???
Sweet!!!! You can live next to me anyday
greg glover i wanna Go Go Liverpool one day too. Bought a Jersey there a couple of years ago when i went to GB. I Like Stuttgart. But i live near Leipzig so i Go There Sometimes. Theyre alright too. Going against Wolfsburg soon. And Keira is a dribbling god :D
Johann S Cool I like Germany friendly people , of course he loves us we love him haha who's your team then , is it Leipzig? what do think of naby keita then ?
greg glover Germany. We got great atmospheres in all Stadiums. Even Leipzig. Just not munich. Those bloody fairweather Fans there are kinda boring xD
Johann S haha I know what you mean , where you from Johann
greg glover i know, we have nice poles here too. Just their holigans are kinda crazy. Atleast they have real Fans in Poland. Not Like munich haha. Hope madrid steps Up now...
Johann S Poland hooligans it's a way of life for them , I know a few poles here in Liverpool they are actually decent people
greg glover italy has Kind of a Problem with Nazi Ultras too as you mention ww2... Like Poland they hardly Control the Ultras there
Gary Fletcher haha he's a legend then part of the magnificent 8 😁💪💪💪💪
Johann S the Italian ultras knew what they were doing and typically run away when the numbers become even , the Italians always run just like they did in ww2
greg glover I can tell you one urchin won't be over there next week with confidence, the others might, because our soft ***** is****** he's my ****** remember they we're in the MAN U end on the top tier silly *******,they got talking to the same manc's when the went down but he said they all had a laugh about it, there is two sides to him and I know them,but some only know one of them,
the fucked up thing is the fought before the game. i don't get it.
greg glover no need for doing that poor fella wasn't even involved in any trouble or kick off(fighting) but they still done him in.if you wanna fight, and it doesn't work out your way then fair enough, but you don't fight in a pack on one man,that's what I call a total shithouse (coward)got told today that one pulled a claw hammer out and was about to hit the man when he was down, but got stopped, it will come out on the tele (television) anyway, hope He's OK,
I hope it's gonna be a crazy Finish in Game 2. Like in almost every Game 2 the previous round.
Johann S if they score 3 we'll score 6 🤣🤣🤣💪💪💪
Gary Fletcher yeah there was major trouble outside anfield , the Roma fans are vile what they did to that feller left him for dead. it's gonna kick off in Rome next week . I'm glad I'm not going there .
I will keep blasting my neighbour with this 😂 Well rome is Dangerous. 3 Goals down didnt Stop them in Barcelona. Its almost the exact situation. But i think Liverpool will learn from barcas failure
greg glover ,bastards done some old fella in they Knocked him clean out, my lad was,he got told its on Facebook, there be ******* off next week,FACT. See you later I'm off !
I was at the game 😁 I live not far from the ground. it was epic , bit gutted about the 2 goals though but shit happens
Johann S 5 - 2 should be OK but wait and see ,keep giving them neighbour some real tunes,
Well i actually am 21. And 75 likes on a YouTube comment is propably my biggest Life achievement so far. Fuck me i guess. Yeah, Liverpool is looking just fine. Ole Kloppo built one hell of a team.
greg glover ,thanks Greg,OH! sorry for my late reply mate.good win tonight LFC 5 - 2 win,one foot in the final ?.next week it's shit or bust.
Tania Boyd thanks Tania,sit back get pissed and chill out,
untill the end of ours days we should always think we are 21....life is just to short to be an adult....also we must not forget to live the present with out thinking about the future or past....enjoy the moment tha best we can.....every time i ear this music it reminds me my big buddy that ya lost is time when we where 18....so ya enjoy my freind
Gary Fletcher happy belated birthday mate ✌✌👍
pmsl your just intro them into excellent music
greg glovery my wife is asleep behind me ,oh! And its my birthday, 48 yrs 2day old bastard, had a few beers and bouncing ( in my head ) I still think I'm 21,_lol.*

If the goal of humanity is to be free. Then penitiary thoughts should be banned from religion just like extraterrestrial thought, no matter what question would pop onto you&#39;re head their is preservance ahead your foreeyes. Don&#39;t mistaken jihadis as a RELIGION, but assapunintended forsaken soul brought from though s truly your forgives. Theirs no other thought than to set to mind to soul that Mexico is our Allie not our hench on the bench. Aliens will exist in you&#39;re world if you enjoy the ecstasy the end will bring you turmoil if you look at it for 2 long. If you believe theirs just two problems from 2+2=4. Then you&#39;re wrong because 2+2=3 in a deck of cards. When you like them together like you would a bowl of rice just like eating 1 grain at a time. 3÷3=1. So what would you&#39;re alternative be?. It would be nothing more than a proven statement. You&#39;re subconscious will think giant. Not. Very pretty but amorous,delicate. Amusi g. But even better transculent emotions youve never imagined in your colour dictionary.petty,thoughts will bring me into your life in a stock market fashion of way. If you want to cuddle with me then I&#39;ll tell those pions to head back to Venus where I&#39;m from and start listening to yours instead.

Hell yeah

I love this dance remix of classical composer Samuel Barber’s “Agnus Dei”, a Catholic mass song, which is his “Adagio for Strings” melody too! It’s beautiful! He uses a part of the melody of those pieces in this remix! I like it a lot! Bravo! 😊❤️🎶
@Meline Hambartsumian Classy lady.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVowLNuV4Zk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkObnNQCMtM Lots of versions, heres a couple, find one that works for you :) ....sorry for the very late reply
Meline Hambartsumian no shit..

Tim Sherwin Would you please send me the link of the video she referred to?
Super User make sure you get the right one!
That's great I didn't know about that, but I just listened to Agnus Dei, I am sorry to say it sounds not even remotely similar to that.
Ive heard choral versions of Barbers Adagio, I didnt know it was called Agnus Dei. I just think of Lloyd Webbers Agnus Dei, which i also love. Listening to Barbers Choral Agnus Dei now, its so beautiful. Many Thanks x
well done, general knowledge 101.
Thank you,but he was playing this 15 years ago. Best DJ ever, if he wants.
Meline, how do you know all of these things? Are you by any chance some kind of classically trained singer with a music degree? If you are then you should mention that. Otherwise i don't think people will take you seriously.
Meline Hambartsumian u
Meline Hambartsumian , zzzzzzzzz
woopy doo
Meline Hambartsumian how are you doing would you like to check my France mix GOJO hère https://youtu.be/FO8t8fvwx70
cornetjohn70 Yes I know he is a 20th century composer, but there are 5 MAIN CLASSICAL MUSIC (as a genre) PERIODS- baroque, classical, romantic, impressionistic and 20th century/contemporary! I have taken music history classes and I’m a musician! I know what I meant to say! 😊🎶 His music is classical but he’s from the contemporary music period! There was also the medieval and Renaissance time periods but they were different types of music and not as popular as the 5 main time periods I mentioned!
Barber is technically a 20th Century composer, not classical.
greg glover You’re welcome! 😊🎶 I also have one video of my piano performance with the orchestra in the Meline Hambartsumyan channel! It was the concert dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the music school I went to at that time, and I was 12 years old then!
Meline Hambartsumian I'll take a look thanks 😁
greg glover I also forgive you for that vulgar comment earlier! It’s ok! 🎶😊
greg glover I’m a classically trained musician so classical music has always been one of my favorite genres that I’m passionate about! You can check out both of my YouTube channels! Meline Hambartsumyan is the old one I had, where I uploaded some opera scenes I was in, in college and old performances from age 15, where my voice wasn’t fully developed yet! Our voices still develop until about ages 28-29! I’ll be 28 in July this year! “My Dear Marquis” and “Old Maid and the Thief” video’s are two of my favorite ones from that channel, and I’m in several scenes for “Old Maid and the Thief”! Also, this channel which I’m typing to you from, has videos my awesome fiancé recorded of me and uploaded as a surprise starting in fall 2015! I’m going to upload more videos on here and in the old one when I get a chance to upload my other opera show performances on tape, lol! I usually need help uploading when it’s not in a format to upload, like still on a video tape! 😄
Meline Hambartsumian yeah sorry it was a little vulgar , but I'm glad you agree 😁👌
greg glover Wow! Well that’s a vulgar way of putting it! 😳 but you’re right! It’s beautiful music for sure! 😊 classical music is very beautiful and relaxing! I’m glad more people are appreciating it now! It takes years to train in classical music, in playing an instrument and singing classically!
Meline Hambartsumian please come sing to me 😁👌😁
Augusto Roa Zarza Yea, one of the movements in a Catholic mass is Agnus Dei and Samuel Barber wrote it as well as used the same melody for his “Adagio for Strings” which is an instrumental piece and has no lyrics! I guess Dj Tiesto listens to classical music and that’s how he did this remix! He only used the beginning phrases of those pieces for this remix! The entire music does not consist of the same repetitive phrases like in this remix! It’s club style remix so it can’t have the entire Agnus Dei song’s melody and the melody of Adagio for Strings (which has the same exact melody) in Dj Tiesto’s remix! I’m glad you enjoyed it! 😊🎶
Jo Palmer it’s definitely beautiful! Did you listen to the original piece this Tiesto remix was taken from? He only used the beginning phrases for his remix! The song “Agnus Dei” from the Catholic Mass is beautiful and I hope to sing it in a choir one day since those kinds of songs are sung with choir usually and sometimes have solo parts! There’s also the instrumental version “Adagio for Strings” by the same composer, Samuel Barber, and that one doesn’t have lyrics! It’s an instrumental piece! I’m glad you enjoyed it! 😊 Classical music is beautiful and great music therapy too!
Meline Hambartsumian a cant believe this came out of a church?
I can't stop playing this 😎 it makes me feel young again lol , this was the best time in my life x
777johnp No it wasn’t Dvorjak who wrote this! He was a Slavic composer and this is definitely by Samuel Barber! I posted a link to his piece “Adagio for Strings” below, and Dj Tiesto took a few phrases from the beginning of that piece to remix in this one! 😊🎶
I thought it was Dvorak, no?
nusaindah81 😊 I’m glad I said all this! I was replying to someone who replied to me (it said so in my notifications) but I don’t see his reply written anymore here, maybe he deleted it!
Wow ... that's a new info for me.
Alec peters, It was not the theme or Platoon! I’m a classically trained pianist and singer! I sing opera and play piano and have heard a lot of classical music! This theme is from Barbers Adagio for Strings which is also Agnus Dei melody! Maybe platoon used that theme but I know what’s correct! I’m a music teacher as well! I teach piano and voice! 😄 Thanks! Feel free to type those names of those pieces and you will hear the beginning part Of adagio for strings and Agnus Dei by Samuel Barber is EXACTLY THE SAME!
Honestly, who dislikes this song?! But who clicks the link, comes, listens, then dislikes it?! Haters or?
OUVINDO EM 2018 !!!! CLÁSSICO
Good musik
Can you talk sweden for me
well said bruh
Isint this like his most famous piece?
Ah my origin song.. the song that got me into edm in the first place. My collection of liked songs has grown to over 600 but this song and trance itself will always be very close to me
I kinda feel like this song is angry. I don&#39;t mind because there is a lot worse than this.
Turkey
this song will always remind me of one night at the club when my friend started crying over her ex-boyfriend who had just broke her heart.... we stood in the middle of the dance floor hugging throughout the whole song. :(
fantastic song

Sha Collnd You can yes but add in a little chemical enhancement of the right kind in a banging atmosphere with like minded people and it’s just raises the bar all the way!
Tiesto was a legend until 2009, After 2010 began to follow the new styles and logic has to evolve a little more in fact he could not evolve in a way that left a mark as an originality in his music, Like he looks like a martin garrix older, Tiesto nowadays is sad :( ..
❤

General street light

Armin the best
one of the best concerts i ever went too was Tiesto, I was high on life for weeks!!
Hoping for dream beach 2018
Tiesto es un dj profesional nadie lo puede negar porque es cierto.. pero resulta que fiestas como la ruta de Valencia no ha extinguido en ningún lugar del mundo por eso para mi mis djs mejores son los valencianos como Jose conca Arturo Roger manolo el pirata y alguno me dejaré seguro.

Best time in world od warcraft and this song comes along, together. so many memories. it is 10 years till I quit &lt;3
me gusta la electrónica, pero me gusta mas la música clásica, para mi esto es una enorme falta de respeto para la original, así que lo llamare &quot;Como echar a perder una obra en poco tiempo&quot;

ZYZZ!!! Fuarrkkk!!!!
NOStalgiAA
Dj tiesto el numero 1
2018
Every great star makes mistakes and this horrible one was the biggest Tiesto could do. Samuel Barber&#39;s Adagio for Strings was played in the movie Platoon, and performed in 2001, as a tribute to New York&#39;s 09/11 horror in London at the Albert Royal Theatre. It&#39;s a sad melody for mournful occasions. Show some respect, Tiesto. Shame on you.
trop bon le son ma man elle adore elle a cinquante ans mais elle assure serieus !
geantisisime oh oui sa envoie
Wow Best house
IMMORTAL soundtrack that will never die
I think this is sexy as hell!!!
No good
any similar song this one ?
Rave away for the 90s we getin older every day but this tune will keeps us young memo hahHah
2005 was 13 years ago fam... that's hella time whether u want to admit it or not
Twisty Games true true true
This was 2005
What great stuff is made off. Tiesto+ Samuel Barber
Very good old trance. I enjoy!
So, charming, powerful, impactful, memorable, emotional... still a top 5 track of all times, for me.
Most beautiful Trance i ever listened

Tiesto es lo maximo en la electronica me encantan.?
old tiesto!!!
✌✌✌
DISLIKE
2020....
TIESTO!!!

All of tiësto&#39;s songs were on my mp3 player when I got it
Esto si que es música de verdad para escuchar durante las fiestas y no el reggaeton y trap de mierda que desgraciadamante hay en la actualidad. ¡La música máquina nunca morirá!
Forever love this song
Vamo a ilnos como yo quiero ....
2018 ??
what a great tune Nothing can deny that, but his piers such as oakenfold, sasha,  digweed, carl cox, just to mention a few, smashed tunes like this all the time... :)
Why can&#39;t I keep still when listening to this track....
when tiesto was good... sad reactions only

W UK już 11 lat, ale sercem Polak ;-) Pozdrawiam i napierdalam ;-)))
Ale można by i dziękować z tymi kilkudziesięcioma tys. zabitymi dzieciakami z powstania oraz co gorsza ok. 200tys cywilów ...i to najlepsza śmietanka wtedy zginęła Warszawy....co do dzisiaj się odczuwa...potem sama wieś zawitała w Warszawie....
no cóż kawałek może się nam kojarzyć z czym tylko chcemy a co do powstania to była wojna więc nie ma co się dziwić tylko trzeba dziękować za wolną POLSKĘ!
Smutny kawałek jednak, oryginał ciągle mi się kojarzy z filmem o powstaniu warszawskim...końcowe sceny, wszyscy zabici, tyle śmierci na marne, młodzież...żal....
Arturek exe jebać ULANE KURWY
Ta piosenka ma basy dla tego jest fajna

It is a poignant but powerful piece considering that Barber wrote this as a lament for Europe in the mid-thirties.

2018 ! The Best
Ein extremes Geleiere verdarb einst die Entwicklung von Musik die eine neue Welt hätte schaffen können. Die Menschen stiegen einfach aus und ohne zu wissen warum, es gefielen ihnen plötzlich theatralische pompöse und in die länge gezogene Kitschsequenzen welche bewußt oder unbewußt jeden Anlauf explosiver Kraftententfaltung in ein eklig süßes und sentimales Geschunkel verwandelte. Bald wurden zu viele Tracks kontaminiert und auf den Festvals wurden die Tänze unterbrochen. Allein mit meiner Wut hörte der DJ nicht das rufen iund es blieb nur sich seinen Teil zu denken. Hier eine der Hauptssequenzen die ständig wiederholt wurden und nichts ließ ausser das Band zurück zu spulen und neu aufzunehmen. Ich reagiere auch heute noch sofort, egal was ich in der Hand hab und stoppe die &quot;Musik&quot;? In Gedanken wünschte ich ihnen allen eine volle Flasche an den Kopf geworfen. Egal was, nach der Schleimig kam nichts groß überraschendes mehr. Ins Altersheim mit dem ganzen schlaffen Scheiß.Man ich krieg heut noch den Hass was haben die genommen?
some dj played it remixed last night on a rave and it was very effective
Done to death, but you gotta like it.
Quando si dice che tutti possono essere artisti riproponendo e rovinando opere eccezionali
fucking sucks

2018 Legends Never Die !!!!!! Tiesto!!!!!!!!
Trance legend\
And tiesto is not dead oO
never
Tiesto is not the legend. The original mix belongs to William Orbit who actually release in 1999 a club version with Ferry Corsten. Tiësto just made a "remix" of the mix.
He died already.
nowt wrong with the trance version...up there in top 10 ever .. but that's the nightlife we had ... imagine this banging from a club abroad . simply beautiful
ramiz hasan *2004
🔥🚀🔥🚀🔥🔥
ramiz hasan this version.. but adagio for strings is an old classical violen song and it was made into a trance song before 05 ... it even has a hardcore version
FatBonEHun yes
i Belive You but in my opinion this song is immortal and Tiesto is a living Legend
FatBonEHun son this song came out in 2006 .
sounds like mac demarco
2018 mfka
el mejor de todos los tiempos sin dudas DJ TIESTO

CD-R
When perfection meets perfection, the emotive triggers of a million encores for the beloved rest within. For this beautiful music I adore Barber and pay homage to the genius of Tiesto who remembered things sacrosanct and yet added his own unique musical simulcara. The most emotional register ever for me - everyone can float, even those no longer with us. Thank you for embracing the transient channels. With your beautiful music, nobody ever really dies. Your work uplifts us. <br>Steve Hammond Kaye:

my Son its Time to blow your Mind away
Superrr...::::::::love and dancyng
It&#39;s from the movie Platoon, the soundtrack from it ... I just want to go to a Rave and dance, but I&#39;m knocking on now, but I can still listen 2 it on my Technics separates..
What a mix, total respect from me... Tiesto!!!
como cuando era un niño feliz y no lo sabia...
He should make more songs like this
Tiësto was da shit in the late 90s - early 2000s... And in 2012, bigroom crap happened. What you listened right here was THE real EDM back in the days. Musicality that transported you in another dimension. No fuckin "drops" just a bpm that kept you dancing, and synths that kept coming and going... Bridges that left you breath a minimum... Now ? Bigroom crap... If you pay attention, you can see how much EDM changed and not for the best... 1. DJaying is not about jumping around and yelling on a mic, while a playback is playing. 2. Best example is when you switch to ASOT Stage/Resistance Stage at the Ultra Festival. There you'll see real DJs, playing live. Not yelling in a mic. Not jumping around. Just playing music live. 3. EDM is so much more than a 130 bpm, with "drops". It includes all the electronic style from Chill Out to Hardcore/Psycore etc. Techno, Dubstep, Hardstyle... all those genres. :)
Listen his forbidden paradise cd's the best
Samuel Barber: Adagio for Strings
Haha, glad you had a laugh! By the way I suggest you check out what the original is based on here - it will give you a real appreciation for the language of music :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRL447oDId4
cerroh you made me laugh when you said the trance lovers will not like young kids listening to music! Anyway thanks you all for your replies 😄😄😄😂😂😂
1. This is based on Agnus Dei Adagio Opus 11 2. Songs like this take a lot of work and development in composition and synth setup, weeks and weeks - sometimes months or even years. Not to mention the mastering. 3. Music like this isn't as popular these days, all the trance lovers will be angry old men and women and complaining about kids listening to "random noises" like my dad to me when I lived for this shit. 4. Never give up hope though. There is still a lot of quality trance composers out there, working away for the passion of music day by day - you just have to find them.

ORIGINAL NICK I’m sorry 😞. I actually feel like that in every instance of life. But sometimes, on these beautiful rare occasions, I get it. I feel that. They’re rare. How about you? Do you get that sort of feeling from other triggers?
Made u comment ,maybe u did feel?
The acid just drop?
I feel the same.
You might want to check Barber's. Both make me cry. This because it's such a bad raped version of the original and the original because it's beautiful.

I can&#39;t fucking believe it it&#39;s 2000 again agh the bliss! Seriously am I the only one who remembers??
2017 Tiesto
2018...?
One of the best of Tiesto...
What are thee You Tube terms of service because I am thinking about this......
A good little roof for thrilling music!! :D
I went. Fuuuucking awesome show
Can&#39;t hold my opinion back any longer. For the reputation that Tiesto had managed to achieve, I cannot believe that this piece of trash ever made it past the cutting room floor. You only have to wait until 1 minute 30, maybe 40 seconds in to hear the &quot; afterthought &quot; background noise he created that somehow attempts to emulate the double note usage that Ferry Corsten managed when he released his masterpiece earlier than this monstrosity. It gets worse too, the longer you listen to it, the more out of sync the double notes get and the more out of place they sound. The remix only starts to come back to some level of average-ness when the baseline changes, but you still have the imprint of the out of sync noise ringing in your ears. At least Ferry Corsten never treated the original with the disrespect by doing it with perfection. Adagio for strings as a piece needs nothing but perfection , and anything less - well - i&#39;d say quit before you even attempt. I did live gigs, turntablism first, then mixology and retired after 17 years of thoroughly enjoying my craft. If I ever did anything as sub-standard as this in front of a live audience, i&#39;d of stepped in front of a bus and deemed my entire career a failure. What makes this worse is the fact that this wasn&#39;t a live mix, it was done in a studio, so he has no excuses to get it wrong. If it isn&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it. If someone has already been there, seen it and done it, avoid it and pick your own original ideas instead of trying to pass this off as your own. I/We know you&#39;re capable of much better, so why release something that isn&#39;t up to scratch? Maybe you fell out of love with Djing?? It happened to me, but right up until my final track, I strived to improve my craft - for the sake of the craft.<br>Marlon Brando once quoted &quot; don&#39;t let the size of your paycheck be a yardstick for how good you think you are &quot;. <br>Rant over.
20/12/2017 &lt;3
isn&#39;t that the music from Platoon ?
Uplifting beautiful tune i can feel a rush coming on !!!
Extacy Music back in the late 1999- and up God i miss it
This is not tiesto original mix song.Its only his remix.The corect name should be Samuel Barber - Adagio for strings(Dj Tiesto remix)
Do some research and you will see...
InnerSyncMusic no it is not get your facts straight
2018 coming soon! LEGEND TIESTOO!!!!

Alex Martin wey no mames, la respuesta ni era para ti xd
a ver chaval yo en ningun momento he dicho que no me guste tiesto solo he dicho que en el dreambeach fue una puta mierda a ver si aprendemos a leer joder
Nadie es mierda, cada quien tiene gustos distintos, hay quien le parece mierda el trance, sin embargo a mi gusto tiesto es bueno hasta ahora, y aunque marshmello esta sobrevalorado debo admitir que tiene buena producción y no es que sea inexperto a ti no te gusta y punto xd
pues en el dreambeach 2017 fue una puta chusta a si que te callas perro
Luv plz

olly shit this is awesome this is music
My King and My Favorite song ! :)
This is one Hell of a song this song is a legend
@Richie Rich Yea I realised that a while back and I didn't know the difference back when I typed this
@Michael Forrest Yea that's for sure
The original classic is far better.
Can't agree more man, found my new favorite song!! xD :D
A song has lyrics. This is a composition.
Chillier Josh Steven gerrard that’s a legend
happy to hear this kind of trance. just cant stop listening this music
The days when they were pumping this in the clubs in Toronto. One hell of a good time.
better add than substract
fantastique
This is the real tiesto, the Vegas version is a clone.
What a fucking cracking tune. Resonates with the depths of my inner soul. Tiesto was deep in the creative zone when he created this masterpiece.
All the artists mentioned in this thread nailed it in their time. Goes to show that a well written masterpiece will live forever. So enigmatic.
Dylan where you from ?
troy lol I'm south African ( I'm Indian) , "poes" is an Afrikaans word for puss or pussy 😂, in South Africa, we speak many languages, I just speak English though
who you actually referring to , the commenter ? or tiesto ?
hahaha... ok then..
it is that south african word
that looks like that south african word..
POES
Keiran Kainth U
all music was from a creative zone at that time and before.
Kevin & Parry go LARGE
Händel's Sarabande is a masterpiece, right, but this is Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings (1938).
You should listen to the original by Samuel Barber then.
Keiran Kainth your a fucking sausage
Its Handel's Sarabande It is a masterpiece though.
Should listen to the original then
Anyone listening in 2018???
Absolute gem forever
James Brennan still listening in middle of march 2018. Masterpiece
yes in 2018
Yes absolute tune
Oui bien sur
Oi oi 10/3/18 and beyond.
James Brennan yep
me too. 💚.
I'll be listening to this and others like it til I die and beyond...... into trance heaven. Love to all xx
Party every day whit a smile live jor live 😎
Yeaaahhh!!
Tuuunnneee!!! Still got my ministry of sound tune card. Hx
Yesssssssssssssss!!
Yup! :-)
James Brennan yes
Shit yeah some solid shit here!!!
It seems everyone is still listening to this tune. YouTube wasn't even invented when it came out originally! You could say the good old days but modern tech has revived a era that should never be forgotten. Reach for the lasers.... safe as ... ;)
One of the tracks where I find inspiration to make good Trance music...
Always

This is a fucking song or track gtfo
Bob Saget Best of all time
No singer and no lyrics= no song. It's an instrumental at best.. As Bob saget, you are expected to know these kind of things!!!
This is no song. This isn't music.
Bob Saget u no that pal
Still a foking blast in da bollz mate!!!
and what about Darude's sandstorm?
And what about Samuel Barber, the author of original music?

vay vay wesley yavaşgelin çifteler oook
Ich liebe Trance aber Tiesto kann gar nix, is so, im Ernst
Back when Tiesto was still playing Trance. Damn.. good old days. My fave part starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a>. It gets you flying, the beat gets your cheeks vibrating, the lights are so blinding yet colourful, you&#39;re wearing your sunnies eventhough it&#39;s late midnight. Dancing all night not feeling a hint of tiredness. Tiesto gets you on a trip for 2 hours plus. Don&#39;t get me started with Elements of Life. Damn.. those were the days.
Oh the memories that just flashed from 15 years ago..before wife and kids and adult bs, when partying your life away was the life..
Good but not exceptional.

This reminds me of being back home, riding through the fog with water on both sides of me, tripping all night and into the morning. Just cruisin and blaring old Tiesto, Sasha and Digweed, etc. Looking back, not my best decision but still a amazing feeling.

Absolutely brilliant, can&#39;t stop listening to it :)
2017. ........?????
This is life described to its full extent by one song. Sorrowful, euphoric, hopeful, nostalgic; all blend in a perfect symphony that explodes into a mesmerizing harmony. Even a moment of clarity outweighs the sum of living. This is 7 minutes of it.
This long last memories in my culture means love
Long live to the Lord
William Orbit with kick drum, sidechain and lead synth.... I kid, this was back when Tiesto was making genuinely awesome remixes (Delirium - The Silence, anyone?). That 1/4 note delayed crash cymbal is one of those weird inspired moments that influenced my own music making and production for years to come just from the spin-off ideas of the technique involved. This one still holds a special place for me.
Wait this isn't even the original remix, well damn. I'll be going now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=5m20s">5:20</a> is and will always be one of the best trance hymns
This is Tiesto! I love him old style of music. Now nothing is like before
It&#39;s just.....Yeah. .....need I say anymore.....oh OK epic tune
Me encanta los Paris tranck
Beautifull memories...

Einer der besten Lieder Übernommen in eine elektronische Symphonie die das innere im Menschen berührt die Seele. Danke
Drugs and TIESTO NOT GOOD IDEA. HELL YEAH
Hello
one of the best songs i have ever heard¡
موسيقى مزيونة.كوينكة
jest moc
Masterpiece
one of the best covers ever...never getting old<br>hatts of to samuel barber,but this is awesome,and better
Does anyone even care that the original piece was written by Samuel Barber and was exquisitely beautiful to begin with? I like this but mostly because i&#39;ve known &amp; loved the original for the last half-century --- and while the treatment of it here is good, it really is just presented differently with new instrumentation and rhythm (the original was more complex, too ... this is just one of its themes.) I just think the original composers should get the credit for what they&#39;ve actually written, that&#39; all, as well as those who&#39;ve added their unique touches.
Elisabeth get a job will you? Moaning cow
original piece is cool but seems more sad/melancholic to me. This one energizes me instead. Maybe I like this one more because it is the first one I listened to
Clearly Tiesto was covering/paying homage to this track, I don't think credit to the original composer is needed
The orginal was the only reason why I even clicked this. But it's good to see a different version of this song with a totally different feeling
Bang on.  The original was far better, but I still like this.

2017 - 2018 :D

Hi
quien lo escucha en 2017?
Yooooo
listening to this and experiencing like... 37 times of goosbumps
the thing I miss the most about being young is recreasional drugs and tunes like this
Best kind of music 2017 and still listening
einfach nur ober geil der track hatte ihn in einem film gehört und gesucht spitze
WTF 9 years!
Kevin and Perry Go Large
I have an exam tomorrow and listening this at midnight with a candle light 🕯
NOSTALGIA AF! O.o
When I listen to this masterpiece I just think wtf happened to tiesto. Needs to go back to his roots
the nation&#39;s profound wife girl mine over speed !!!
I like the new tiesto cuz he produces multiple styles like big room( &lt;3 ) and deep and progressive house he is truly a legend, although trance is good too
Unearthed the short-known moisture of trance that once was natural to me in childhood sleep. Fuck the politicians, fuck the billionaires, fuck the celebrities, and fuck the race itself. We ain&#39;t rats. Listen to this and chill out on some dopamine. Damn! Whiskey&#39;s dry in my state.
Old But Gold . Best Tiesto Everrr :(
Toscanini loved this cut by Samuel Barber and he broke it out on his radio show in 1938. Sam was just a young man a went on to great acclaim but all that people remembered him for was his Adagio for Strings.
Hell yeah That’s what I call music
Katarina Pau thanks Katarina nice name 😁💕smidnightcaller xx

the good ol days.
i just stumbled upon this while listening classic music. i know that everybody has his own taste, but i honestly feel this as an insult to the excellent music it came from. it has nothing of the melancholic deep feelings left, but serves as an witness of lacking creativity
Nada que ver con la caca de remake de mark sixma
Donde quedó tu buena música tiesto, pese a ser una nueva reidicion de la canción de Samuel barber, es una de las más recordadas pero la nueva música y remix que haces no es nada con esta joya que creaste, donde quedó todo ese talento que tenías.
I literally had chills listening to this song at Something Wicked. I had the honor to experience this masterpiece. Best song of the Rave..
Good music, my heart is happy. 😄 😂
Yuton ತ_ಎತ skidaddle skiddo is gay and so is your picture. Looks like a man is giving u head

Лет 10 назад ездил на поезде в Париж и обратно. Помню, познакомился с классной чувихой, но одета она была как роккер типа. Очень любила слушать хард рок, всякая хуета. Предлагала мне послушать, но я отказывался. Потом как то достала наушники, дала послушать этот трэк, я удивился очень, так как она рок всегда слушала. Тут она мне и сообщила, что это транс музыка. С тех пор я познал транс и своего любимого диджея Тьесто. Под этот трэк я порой даже слезы проливал. Но по моему этот трэк я буду показывать своим детям. Это легенда и без преувеличений!!!
The tune almost the same as that Stephen Kings movie sleepwalkers
Why am I crying in the club rn
No entiendo tadavía porque tiesto se cambió del trance a otro género si tiesto era perfecto en el trance.

Don&#39;t cry because it&#39;s over.<br><br>Smile because it happened.

I've told many people about that quote, (Don't cry because its over, smile because it happened) They're all agreeing that this individual has also been there,seen it,and done it,and knows what what they're talking about,it's the best quote relating to music I've certainly heard. Anyway 2018 anyone?.
The original one is quite sad but in tiesto style, so different man. Wow I listen it til 2018

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVowLNuV4Zk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVowLNuV4Zk</a> - somebody maybe don&#39;t knows this is orginal song
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a> it&#39;s so familiar but it&#39;s like I&#39;ve heard this part of the song in a game or somewhere but I just don&#39;t know where? Any idea?
https://youtu.be/1xiengwqh64?t=1m28s Is this what you are looking for?
Dreads it might have been the original Samual Barber version and it was in Homeworld I think （⌒▽⌒）
The "Adagio for Strings" melody was not composed by Tiesto. It was composed by Samuel Barber, a 20th century classic composer. That's probably why you have heard it elsewhere too.
It's in the film platoon idk if that's what you were thinking of goon bag
Dreads kevin and Perry go large the film ?
Hello word

OUTSIDE DANNCE TRANCE
This is the best song of tiesto.. love the song so much and feel the beat...
inigualable tiesto
If you don&#39;t like or think this song is crap. You don&#39;t deserve the privilege of listening to this master piece.
Trance really get emotions on a deep level..and this is one of the classics.
This song reminds me of a horrible brake up, watching the slut snogging a guy on the dance floor. Good riddance I can&#39;t enjoy the classic tune n laugh about it
Minted 😑
He played this at Imagine Festival 2017 in ATL...<br>I fell in Love with Trance all over again!!!
Ya damn right let your eardrums bleed

Luke Fon Fabre yes I do @ 33yo
Tiesto Power
I love how made a rendition of Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber. Shows homage to the old days of orchestral music. Barber wrote his music in the early 20th century

What happened to the old days of MDMA, the stuff about now is apparently pure 100% MDMA but it just mongs me out and makes me feel trippy/drunk rather than the little fellas of the late 90&#39;s forwardslash early naughties. Was there something else in the tablets then or what? I would seriously LOVE to feel that love and unity once again some time! ANSWERS ON A POSTCARD KIDS, CHEERS

Tune and a half always gets the hair tingling, off your nut buzzing out of your mind and that pumping bass, tiesto I salute you
This song has been ultimate tune for me, almost like a drug since I discovered it. Like damn. Heaven on earth. This song is in my opinion the best electronic piece of music ever created (Though it&#39;s a remix of a classical piece). Like seriously. Put this song at any video game, movie, montage or any other media. It becomes epic. This song takes me to another place. The energy, the feels. There&#39;s no bad thing to say about this song. Best song ever created.
If you like this you should try Pink Floy'd "Echoes". It has the same build up and release, and it's FUCKING EPIC
I feel the same of this song, is like a part of my life!
Viper Girl its also very good

I still remember the pill I took the first time I ever heard Tiestos version.<br>The tingles down my spine,<br>The waves of lasers,<br>The goosebumps.<br>The euphoria.<br>The buzz.<br>The Lift off.<br><br>The Syndicate - Blackpool
I&#39;d still recommend a chip of an acid next to it.

I hope it comes the day when people stop talking about Old Tiesto vs. New Tiesto and just hear their favorit songs. Just shut up. Tiesto is a genius and makes perfect music since 1994 till today, deal with it.

This gets in tune with any emotion you&#39;re experiencing right now and every time you&#39;ve listened to it....trAnce loVer 4 liFe
The sounds together are totally AMAZING stoned. My rave days music is so much DEEPER on weed, in my opinion. Epic as fuck sober tho as well. Never stop
i still get chills listening to this perfection !!!! 2017
The best song tiesto
I sniff good cocaine while listen this masterpiece and this fucking awesome!!
C&#39;est juste UNE des références de toute une époque !!! Simplement une REFERENCE !! C&#39;est même plus génial, super ou autre adjectif : une REFERENCE !! J&#39;adore trop ^^
2017
By the way...believe or not, when listening to this and its off-rhytm again after years, I started to think that this could not write and compose Tiesto. And just few comments below, I found Him-Samuel Barber. Wow...this one from Tiesto sounds like bad live keyboard recording without adjusting the rhytm on chords changes
I dont know how many people realized it ...but the main theme is really of rhytm. Quite a newbie thing. True musicians will aprove this who got sense of well made track. Btw this was one from my favorites, and still is. But as I got older, I noticed this beginners fails...which shocked me in comparison how he is famous
in 2012 i went to a Tiesto Festival here in my city and guess what he didn&#39;t even show up he canceled. looser but song goes hard af.
still an awesome song
😎
From the days when trance was all we wanted and lived for:)
Fuvkon savage
still here 2017 TIESTO!!!!!
Hi is goods left arm $A 😎
T(r)iesto: make up your own muzak! If you&#39;re considered by many as such a GENIUS (FCOL - LOL) I&#39;m quite sure you can come up with an ORIGINAL theme/melody of your OWN...

Ich habe mir vor einiger Zeit beim Dj in der Disco das Lied gewünscht und der Dj fragt mich allen ernstes wer Tiesto sei. Danke für&#39;s Gespräch.

This song is good, but it really bothers me when people who like this kind of music criticize newer music and say that it&#39;s too simple. (It especially bothers me when they assume people who like new music are &quot;brain dead&quot; or only listen to it because they don&#39;t know that trance exists.) If you listen closely, you can hear how repetitive this song is. The same chord progressions (which themselves are made of smaller progressions that keep repeating themselves over and over while simply moving up a key) appear again and again. The use of multiple lead layers creates an illusion of complexity, but the layers themselves are very repetitive. The end result does sound good, and the point of this post wasn&#39;t to criticize trance or to say that other genres are necessary more complex. I&#39;m just saying you shouldn&#39;t believe that the people who make or listen to trance are inherently smarter than people who make or listen to other genres.
It seems like everyone in this reply chain ignored what my original comment actually said. I have listened to ALL kinds of music, and I still like EDM the best, okay? You don’t have to understand it; you just have to stop assuming something is wrong with me.
1st of all it seem very simple to this day not in early 2000's when this was made 2nd sometimes you dont need to try so hard to come up with something.. 3rd and final he did what everybody to this day do "take a known sample and mix it".....
All music has repetitive beats wtf thats how you make music you repeat beats. But mix in a good way so it sounds good. Everyone has their preferences. But it just sounds like you got butthurt by some hardcore trancehead on steroids maybe follower of zyzz who dissed you for liking new music instead of trance. I mean really ur gonna make a long paragraph comment just to talk back smack into the trance community for some people dissing you over new music? Get the fuck outta here with that shit. It's bullshit like you who I have to waste over 5 minutes getting involved in the comments then 5 more minutes of writing another paragraph back to set your ass straight. There's gotta be almost months worth of time responding to complaining snots like you.
The1andonlyAbber at the risk of stating the obvious, the music is called tran e BECAUSE it is repetitive and sends people into an, erm, trance. And electronic dance music generally is repetitive, if you go to a rave and the du is any good you will be listening to one long uninterrupted beat. I find your comment strange. However it is a known fact that music affects intellect. The music nowadays is created specifically to dumb us down, whereas classical music actually raises intellect. I don't know if you are aware but years ago, eg classical era, music was in 432hz, which is known to resonate with the human body frequency and is healing and beneficial. Music has been produced in the unhealthy, "demonic" frequency of 440hz for a long time. Try for yourself, look up some 432hz music and feel t he difference. We are talking vibratory levels, which affect mental and physical health. It was not done by accident. As an addendum, anyone who doesn't know. This track is a remix of Samuel barbers piece from t he 1930s and you would do yourself a favour to listen to it. Also this song is probably one of the most haunting beautifully sad evocative pieces of music ever written imo... You can literally feel what the composer was trying to say https://youtu.be/AiuC_CaObbI ... Enjoy, on good headphones or loud, it sounds awesome on my Bose sound wave.
The Repetitive nature of the song puts them in a Trance, that's the purpose of it.
JoDo class
The1andonlyAbber u a d!ck
The1andonlyAbber Spoken like a real nigga
yeah i maybe be simple , but its got that vibe what makes you vibrate feel it tiesto is a dj no a musician he make a great job with this song simple but its got that vibe thats what it counts ,..... to have a vibe ,, to make you feeel ... original or not he did aa great job
True but then again, this is Tiesto. All the man ever did was take the work of others, fiddle around with it (generally making it worse in the process) and put it back out as his own. Not an original bone in his body.
To me music is music as long it has really good beat to it I grew up to all types of sound but to me the mid 80's to 2000 + my kinda year
well put mate
I guess the earlier you came from, the snobbier you are :)
The1andonlyAbber k then 😂 you only needed to say stop criticising
and then William Orbits version... both surpassing this crap ofc... :)
wrong point. chord progressions was never the point of edm as a whole. edm can't race with jazz when it comes to chord progressions so it's pointless to talk about it. edm is much more about the soundscapes, the texture, the timbres, the FX (filter sweeps and many many more), samples, and how all this let's say vertical stuff is arranged horizontally - the song structure, buildups and breakdowns, layer after layer, apexes, breaks, variations, fadein-fadeout etc. and this album Just Be is really fucking strong at it - complex only to the point where it doesn't cross the threshold of self-indulgence. so the relatively simple chord progressions really don't make this song simple, actually.
Yann Giovanelli i think everybody know that
Samuel Barber 1938 original version ! It is just a mix guys ! Wake up !!!!
Don't worry, those who liked the William Orbit remix (9 years before Tiesto's remix) fucking hated this one.
The1andonlyAbber STFU!!!
Totally agree you shouldn't judge people for liking "new" music or otherwise. You either like it or not. Nothing to do with intelligence. But also music can not be subject to peer review as if its science. I'm not worried about repetition or simplicity. I just like it. Simple an pure.
Dear Diary...
I love all genres, but you cannot classify a genre when it is still new. This song will remain in our hearts forever because it is unique and doesnt only burst our emotions related to rage, but others as well. The new EDM, yes in the beginning it was incredible, but the producers killed it. They produced the same sound and structure over and over. Nevertheless, the new EDM is based on rage; the majority of it is useless for us. Yes you can judge 90s and 2010s. The difference can be seen. Today money is the main goal, everything becomes mainstream. Before, they did it for love.
This song was created by Samuel Barber. This is just Tiesto's "remix" or interpretation of it.
But this Classical
I have no clue buy what people are referring to as "new music", though there are certainly certain subsets of pop culture that is simplistic in every form of analysis. It's not minimalist, just plain simple and uninspired, yet it's still worshipped. I know i have a bias but If I can compose, produce, mix and master a song in a day at my current ability then I know what I have made is trash. Yet I can make many pop/hip-hop tracks comfortably in that time without even stressing my mind.
The1andonlyAbber then hear the original piece by Samuel
HOY ESTOY DESTRTUIDOOOOO PERO AL STILO

MISS THOSE YEARS . THIS IS REAAAAALLLY TRANCE............ BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE::
grolllingggggggg hard
Amir Zakwan haha awesome. But man do you have any openings as of now? I have a bachelor's of commerce degree, graduating in aprl/may of 2018. I can be your employee. you can ask what ever you asked your employee while joining the corp like you did when you were an HR. Haha 😛 I'll drop in my resume.
•non'ya biznez• Degree in Business Logistics. But my business is not related to logistics at all. In fact when I graduated, I worked in Human Resources as a recruiter. Lol.
Amir Zakwan bro awesome to hear. Happy family. It's 10 years back then. Haha. What degree did you graduate with. How's business going
TheLittlestMig Well, now I have a 8 month old baby girl and started my own business. My free time is to spend with the missus and baby.
Why are they "those years" and why they WERE the best years of your life? Did you just give up the decent stuff? What happened to you?
•non'ya biznez• 19 years old. It was during my college study break. Ferry Corsten, Dash Berlin and Tiesto. Awesome stuff.
Amir Zakwan so you were 18 at that time. Haha awesome
I am now 29. When Tiesto came to Malaysia it was 2008. Damn. One of my best raves.
I feel you bro. Back when Tiesto was still playing Trance. Damn.. good old days. My fave part starts at 1:30. It gets you flying, the beat gets your cheeks vibrating, the lights are so blinding yet colourful, you're wearing your sunnies eventhough it's late midnight. Dancing all night not feeling a hint of tiredness. Tiesto gets you on a trip for 2 hours plus. Don't get me started with Elements of Life. Damn.. those were the days.
Grethe Barlyng what is y'all age now?
Grethe Barlyng
No why would i?
Grethe Barlyng wish I were alive in its prime, my mum got me started on clubland and trance

Went to see Tiesto live while in Ibiza back in late July 2009. We were wall-to-wall on the dance floor. Just jumping up and down. Fucking amazing. Privilege was the venue (considered to be the largest night club in the world with a capacity of 10,000). Unforgettable night.
Old but Gold

The music industry owns you when it comes to producing music now he's probably been told that's not the way now!
He needed to pay bills. Lol that’s what happened.
This kind of music doesn't sell anymore.
Stephanie Roberts money...what else is here to explain?
Man thats the real question :(
He started producing mainstream bullshit like 'BOOM'...
2017 happened... :/
Whats the name of the song?
2017 y sigue como la primera vez
All Time favorite

Mayo 2017!!!
2017 !!
Hmm, nice but I still preffer Ferry Corsten&#39;s remix
2017 ♫
one if my favourites awesome x
the idea was brilliant, and production is flawless (of course) but it lacks creativity (only one, recurring motif) and the arrangements are.. ok. <br><br>hopefully it has brought some to check out the original adagio (s. barber).
super
2017🔥
Kevin n Perry go large brought me here
This reminds me of Fast and Furious
nostalgia!!
SPEED UO CÓR ICES
this song can be remixed 1,000 times over and over and still cannot beat the original, it does not matter if you remixed this song now or 100 years into the future, ladies and gentlemen i present to you a song without words yet it speaks in another language more powerful than words
I&#39;m meant to be cooking the Sunday lunch (puff puff)
RIP ZYZZ. FOREVER MIRIN
I&#39;m partial to Orbit&#39;s version. First single I ever bought back in the day
Die Hookline hätte ich besser gestaltet. Aber hinterher kann man immer meckern^^
This is class! feck off all you fannys.  Deal with it! whats war got to do with it!?  were you listening to the radio at the time!!!!!
Tiesto, you disrespectful son of a bitch fuck you and your fucking no-taste-in-music fans.
Not really. It lacks the heart of the original.
This is better than the original.
TripNBallsGaming classical masterpiece or not it’s still an awesome track
paul lenton It would be better if it didn't butcher a classical masterpiece.
Fucking awesome track that’s what it is 😉
Estos fueron mis principios de escucha electrónica fue por casualidad buscando el sountrack de platoon y wow nunca mas fui el mismo y ahora después de años se me presenta de nuevo así es así es así comienzo mi viernes
Yup. This guy should be teaching lessons on how to ruin a classical masterpiece.
Srabya Aybarsov AGREEE adagio for strings is such a nice piece and dafuq is this??
What a TUNE!!!!
2017 ,, still one of the best trance tracks of all time ..
zyzzzzzzz
die besten Trancetracks entstehen aus der klassischen Musik
mint
lol meiste likes
Kleiner Peter, nie im Leben, vlt. später!
Alexander, aber das erkennen nur die wenigsten! Wer kennt denn noch, die guten alten Dj's?
fuck u goethe
Arya Yavz only Legia Warsaw
Klassik ist doch fast schon trance nur ohne richtigen bass
Dj tiesto ist king
J.B dich
Alexander Crufer yes
Peter Hansen Äh......Doch......... 😃
Alexander Crufer A! Deutsch! Ich mag die deutsche Sprache!
Ähh..nein. Samuel Barber würde sich wohl im Grabe umdrehen! In Filmen wie "Platoon" oder "Der Elefantenmensch" wirkt so ein Stück. Das hier hört sich einfach nur scheisse an !
💢💢💓💓🎧🎼🎶🎵🎶
The best !💖💖
Le meilleur 💖
Alexander Crufer what is your favorite song
Tiesto hat es eher gecovert ^^
:)
I speak english but I think die besten means "the bestest" so I'll give it a like.
Alexander Crufer don’t understand german. But, yes, you’re correct. Danke.
+Zsofi Sarkadi sff
+Gary Heath zgg
+Gary Heath sfgd
Alexander Crufer/ das ist richtig!
If you wana lission to sum tunes" look for classic trance nation "
Yeahhh das stimmt!!!!
i dont know a word of German but i understood that!!!
Ich stimme zu
Alexander Crufer Weź ten... Odpisz.
Thank uhhjhcbivgn
the best trance tracks are created out of classical music
Does that say something like The best trance tracks use classical music? I don't read German but some of the words look familiar. I definitely agree :) And Tiesto has always been great at blending both together!
Oh how legends fall...why tiesto? why adapt to the shitty mainstream sound? Its honestly hard to believe that such potential is being wasted on now only making 3 min tracks with a drop and repeat it...Greately dissapointed but hes a legend none the less, just wish he stayed true to his original sound.
2017 and this Song is already amazing !!!
I heard the original Adagio from the film Platoon.
Heard this first watching kevin and perrys hahah
awesome rhythm
r.i.p Robert miles
Wow, so beautiful this amazing song yeaaaah ☺
Florina Phalanx this is my music
Florina Phalanx e Non

Florina Phalanx i agree
Florina Phalanx 😉
What a tune
Therte was a time when Tiesto was considered like a fucking living God of music
Nice! :D
One word : legendary
best trance ever
its pretty sad that this has double the clicks of barbers original version
Rly cry when listen it... memories flashbacks too strong mate
auuuuuu meus 17 anos
my uncle used to listen to this while he did homework and I would be raving in same room, he&#39;d kick me out sometimes because I was 5 and had no concept of quiet😂 I think this is why I love raves
No one can take Tiësto&#39;s place, sorry people.
If You See This, Can You Please Chek Out My Last Video ?❤<br>If You Do Like Leave Support That Will Make Me So Happy! Thank You❤
still beats strong
Excellent
ill always remember that warm summer day when I was 17 years old and popped a couple white G lady bombs. 10 years later I can say this music has inspired me so immensely. so grateful I have crossed paths with this music. so many memories. life is good 😎
good but no thanx
Still best trance ever!!!!!!. That era hasn&#39;t been replaced with anything better,....<br>Yet
Excelente tema!! Lo seguiría escuchando en este 2017 y más!!! 😉✌
Класс!

I'm in my 40s - get our own culture! Or at least pass the smoke and take your top off.
Why did Tiesto ruin his music? I miss this Tiesto.
How on earth does this have so many more views than the original?
over played and over rated
TRANCE 😍
Does the crowd in the picture mov every now and then or I am drunk?.
herkezi trance müzikle tanıştıran koca yürekli adam senide unutmadık!

I thought that the spirit of the trance music was over
ur fucking what 😎😎
but who knows that music in this song made people from auschwitz and it was an anthem of auschwitz camp
This is the grandfather of the EDM. This is the original!🙌
I wonder if this is an edit...

Crap mix. The original is sooooo much better.
NHKのクラシック音楽館を見ててたどりつきました！弦楽のためのアダージョ（バーバー） ですって！やっぱクラシックとTranceは相性抜群ですね！日本語わかんないか。え~、this song。。。英語がわかりません！

Antiloop - In my mind

I wonder how many people knows who is original artist of this song.
do you remember? when you was young in disco listen to this song, and felt like the king, like the most beautiful guy. Some years later you watched a picture of that time and realized, omfg i was so ugly, and spastic^^
Adagio for Strings. Warum denke ich an String-Tangas?

What a progression (transition) at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=2m41s">2:41</a>&#39; thats AWESOME. Just like the meaning  of FLYING high. So COOOOL.. But also the downfall (decrease, falling) at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=3m45s">3:45</a> is GREAT

2017 watchers?
theme to the movie Platoon by oliver stone
i miss old times ;(
fucking awful.
Why I want to cry when memories come back to me while listening to this ?
protess5 maybe you should remember who was with you before the climb and try make contact with them again peace 🤙🏼
I was17 first trip ........
It has become increasingly hard to listen to this music. It's like my mind is broken into a million pieces, and art like this makes me realize it. It was like that back in 2008, it's like that now. The memories of driving with my girlfriend in my old sports car, I was thin and handsome, and she was beautiful. Now 11 years later I have all the money I could ask for and a job that takes me around the world, but in my quest for greatness I lost her, and most of my friends in the climb.
flowApot me too.
thats the magic of trance
I love both this and the classical version! They&#39;re so different but so great at the same time
áááááááááááááááááááááááááááááááááááááááááá
A song like this can inspire a man to move mountains
CLASSIC
If we could take back time!! to the good old days!!

This song is my fav trance music. it s touch my hearth.i wish return old days to the good days
Original adajio for strings is one of the best melodies human ever created.
I believe in using REAL drums and Cymbals. Let&#39;s re-mix all E.D.M. With the good stuff! Keepin&#39; it real! Tiesto is my favorite DJ. He allows his Musick to introduce him at most events! Respect to the #1 DJ Tiesto!!!!!!!!
2017 escuchando la musiquita

hırsız bu adam
FRITAAAAAAAAAAAAA MALUCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nieśmiertelny sztos!
Really enjoyed your clip, Watch out Elsiane&#39;s new video Unstable here:
thechno its make me feel damaged slowly 😎
très bon son
Tiesto back in the days was far above any DJ&#39;s no matter what the genre (who the fuck was David Guetta while he was making sick house music), he just climbed to peak and bred many well known DJ&#39;s (even Armin and helped Ferry Corsten), now he&#39;s just trying to look dumb by making cheap house music in the shadows.<br><br>Asides from Paul Oakenfold, Sasha and Carl Cox, Tiesto was a legend in his own right, at his own level where no one ever reached.
I’m reminded of my sons homework
+torintorintorin Show me this quote please?
I'd say they helped each other overall. However, it was Ferry first - to quote Tiesto himself: " I have always been in the shadow of Ferry Corsten with my productions..."
Jovanna Figueroa I thought Tiesto got famous before Ferry, although everyone knows that Ferry had a longer career (1989 officially).
Jefferson Huang helped ferry Corsten???? Other way around
Tru tru
Okay yeah since they're a electronic band they deserve their own throne too.
Jefferson Huang Because imo faithless deserves a shoutout if we are talking about DJs
Sean Byrne It was, but what did that have to do with the comment lol
Faithless insomnia is a ducking tune tho tbf
Tiesto in gaming videos? That's pretty good to know.
hell ya man i miss the good ol'e 1.6 cs days when we used to use the command to auto play songs in server. good times man
Oh god i remember Tiesto's track being played at the end of every single round in Counter Strike 1.6 .... Or when some1 played these tracks on speakers & turned on the mic. so that every1 will listen to it :DD the good old days
+Ignacio Cantero ATB is talented, yes, but most of his stuffs back then (Movin' Melodies) were just too laid back and simply made for enjoyment.
Jefferson Huang ATB one of the best Djs as well
still his songs back than were more unique, like acceptable in the 80's, im not alone, bounce...
Calvin was never a sellout, because he started with pop EDM, and was still pop EDM
@Jefferson van der Huang but some people (not really) thinks he's a sellout, and it's not true 
@Brayan Argandona Florentino He never let us down because he always was consistent with his genre, his songs are catchy and addicting, but as a high quality producer I think otherwise.
@Jefferson van der Huang but Calvin Harris in the other hand he does song all by himself by writing it, produce it, compose it, managing it, Calvin Harris never let us down
@Brayan Argandona Florentino Tiësto had tracks that he took credit of too, but every artist has to be an influential force of his or her own work.
@Jefferson van der Huang in reality he never made his own song, he hires a lot of writers, producers and other dj's
@Brayan Argandona Florentino He used to be okay, now he's just poppy annoying.
Jefferson van der Huang I hate David Guetta
Maybe I&#39;m crazy...No...I definitely am. But still...This is one of the most epic pieces of music ever written or composed!
this loser even fucks up adagio...
1 of the best traCKS EVER !!!
this tune IS DEFO a tune I used to listen to while waiting to come up, timed nice when the drop hits at the same time your drugs drop!! Good memories!!
ÇOK BÜYÜK ADAMSIN TIESTO !
This is gonna be my anthem for when humanity succeeds into the future.

with love from 2017.Greatest trance music
2016 and still listen to this.
trance in puré state!!
Who else feels Chills everytime you play it?
When you in the club and all of a sudden you have Vietnam War flashbacks.
sick TUNE G
Oh fuck, why?????? please no, why &quot;adagio for strings&quot;? ah, whatever...
rappelle de bon vieux souvenir
nostalgia &lt;3
de la patate
En un concierto de estos Grandes del Trance Era épico la censacion que te trasmitía a través del alma ERA MÚSICA
Even in 2017 when this comes on in a club you know shit is about to get real
I just dig up the whole youtube back to 1998 to find this track, and after 7 hours the title came to the surface.. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23worth">#worth</a>
What song do you guys think is better? Adagio for strings or Elements of life?
No se como algunos tarados pueden decir que esto no es música. No sólo lo es, es algo casi místico, la mezcla de los sonidos, los ritmos, la emoción, la coloratura de las melodías. LA SUBLIMACIÓN DE LAS SENSACIONES!
Música electrónica casi analógica sin programas de computadora como lo hacen los DJs de ahora 14 años tiene esta joya y suena más elaborada que las pendejadas del cabeza de malvavisco
Me encanta!
Es gente imbécil amigo
LA SUBLIMACIÓN DE LAS SENSACIONES! Perfect !!!
Simplemente es por que no saben lo que es buena música
Que nostalgia,esta fue lanzada en 2004 :'v
carol orellana Tarada tu que no sabes que esto es una copia del adagio de Samuel Barber
carol orellana estas en lo cierto te transporta al mundo de nunca jamás

Platoon&#39;s song &lt;3
One of the best &amp; all time favorite. takes me to a completely different mindset. goosebumps rise and my body can&#39;t help but move when I hear it.
Remember hitting the A&#39;s hard to this many times.....
Dawne czasy ale przyjemne, super
why does this remind me of the soundtrack to the movie &quot;platoon&quot; if you dont believe me just play the intro when charlie sheen gets off the c130
2017 aun lo escucho ♡ :&#39;v
Worst tune ever.
I&#39;m not going to get up and take another beer till the end f this song

Looking for a techno song, thinking it was a Russian, not going too hard, there was a woman singing, it started with something glittering and then it speeded up seem like I cannot find it :/ but daim these old songs gives me the chills!
Aliensaurus I'm 44 and still pumping listening to this. 😁

SAMUEL BARBER ADAGIO FOR STRINGS IS THE REAL HERO......
Tiesto🎵 = 💙💙
I believe most of us came searching after this song after we heard the Platoon soundtrack at the end of the movie
2ide
h
The best of all times
This guy took Samuel Barber&#39;s composition! Isn&#39;t that illegal???
I would say a lot more people have heard of Samuel Barber than Tiesto to be honest.
This guy? He's litterally more famous than SAmuel Barber, Tiesto did Sam a favour
Cuanta nostalgia :&#39;v
cool music
Who else is here from the French truck driver/refugees on highway video?
Me
Fricken Emerson s
Kevin and Perry
FOR THOSE WHO DON´T KNOW ADAGIO FOR STRINGS IS A CLASSIC PIECE COMPOSED BY AN AMERICAN CLASSICAL MUSICIAN , AND I MAY SAY IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECES COMPOSED TILL TODAY THIS ADAGIO FOR STRINGS WAS COMPOSED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE XX CENTURY AND BRING ME TO TEARS WHENEVER I LISTENING THE COMPOSER WAS SAMUEL BARBER AND I WAS SURPRIZED WHEN I HEAR THIS PIECE BEEN ADAPTED IT COULD BE BETTER, ,BY AN ELETRONIC MUSICIAN I´M FAN OF IT .
power papa!
i miss so much this Tiesto :( He has changed a lot ! :&#39;(
learn to open your third eye
This song is a perversion of the actual meaning of the original piece of music

Age of dubstep?? The guy with deadmau5 on his profile pic, I like you.

Better than the orignal
hola
رائع جداااااا
is very good song
he understands
vivaldi pls ? some comment nao!
not Vivaldi but Barber.
If you liked this, you&#39;re gonna love the original version composed by Samuel Barber. It is so hauntingly beautiful
Brendan Garvey.. The original version was never intended as a dance choon. So how can you call it 'weak'? The original was intended to be what it is. Sadly all these DJ's do is hash up old choons because they haven't the ability to write their own music, play an instrument or compose an orchestra. Sampling choons is basic plagiarism..
The original was indeed beautiful, but as a trance anthem wannabe, this is dreadful. You need to listen to Ferry Corstens masterpiece, he never used the tune as an afterthought, he used the spine of it, infused it with drama and emotion and set you on a rollercoaster of 4 highs, each progressively harder hitting. The last " peak " throws you at the ceiling and leaves you there. You ain't coming down.
Homeworld exposed me to that classical piece years before tiesto
William orbit did a version of this listen too it classic
Yeah I loved the original way before this version. I wish Tiesto's version covered the entire piece rather than the first part only, because I enjoy this mix too.
Yes, but it's a bit weak compared to the dance versions, lacking the energy to break it out of it's inertia and listlessness. I don't think Tiesto's version is the best, either. I prefer the directness of the K Complex version.
see slipknot psychosocial
Think you're missing the point.
Orchestras convey so much more drama and emotions IMO :)
Laurent Detaille I agree, it's such a beautiful (and sad) piece.
Gilbertjames007 on YouTube :D Samuel Barber - Adagio for strings
Laurent Detaille where can I find it?
Oh my god when Tiesto was king.
they should make a tiesto cs go music kit
waaahnsinnn.....waaaaahnsinnnnn
One of the greatest trance tracks ever!
I like lamb meat.
this reminds me of the good old days in high school! all the parties and fun haha !!! the early 2000s were sick! such a shame he sold out...smh
GOD OF TRANCE!!!!
J&#39;adore se mec trop bon Yesss
You compare this masterpiece to the shit he does these days...and you can&#39;t help but ask, HOW did they fuck up so bad!?
those days were about pure passion, now is just money!!!
zodiac909 all he really does is edit songs lmao i mean hes not bad tho
zodiac909 I complete my agree..... it's rare to hear anything of the old days here.... honestly makes me sad. But hey, at least we know of the good days eh? N can still listen
agree. people dont even know who wrote the original piece. such a shame, they just think he wrote it or something.
Tiesto is doing big room now but still his songs are great, The only way is up , Secrets , these are great songs. But don't compare them with this masterpiece. If Tiesto would continue to do trance he wouldn't be what he is now, a EDM LEGEND.
To be fair this is a still from a classical music track!
zodiac909 Could say the same for the original.....
Because this music isn't popular now so he pays to put his name next to big room tracks
PlatinumEagleStudio's No. Tiesto took the William Orbit version and covered it. William Orbit-Barbers Adagio For Strings is the proper trance version
How can I not like this? Easily. Very easily.
@AJ Miller BUT Tiesto was making a tribute to a famous classical piece with this though. This remix is amazing. How can you NOT like this???? Tiesto does Trance music so he turned Adagio For Strings into Trance, witch I think works very well. I'm gonna do a melodic Dubstep remix of this because I love the tune so much.
And then compare THIS shit to the masterpiece that is the original piece....and then ask yourself....what happened to real music?
👌👌👌😟
@Durrant Miller Thank you :-)

We are made of drugs, that's why drugs work on us. We are a vessel run on substances, similar or many times the same you find in "drugs". Used correctly, is a fucking lost technology of sound and psycodelics. A portal to a place most people never see during their entire life.
I did both and I totally, completely, lost my shit when Tiesto dropped this. Trance for ever.
LoL...Adriano For String is designed to be heard on drugs. Drugs enhance the experience by 1000 times 🙃😁☺
Drugs and this? High AF, miss that old times..
hahahahaha
its the same :D
why do drugs atoll?
Section the begins right after 1:20 is absolutely psychedelic.
2 David bowies and this is heaven all in itself..
why not do do drugs while you adagiong for strings?
Mazen Izzeddine so true !!!!!!!
drugs are life
Drugs are amazing. Adagio for stings is amazing why wouldn't you combine the two and feel that rush as the drugs start to take hold.
Tiesto and 40mg pure Molly, now that's a way to party.
i highly recomemd both in moderation
Yes it is.
Mazen Izzeddine Weed improves music. That's why. It will actually put you in a "trance". It's awesome
jason x The beauty of you suggesting drugs make anything more amazing than it actually is... then the punchline "wake up..." Do you understand what it really means to wake up?
Because drugs make this more amazing than it actually is. wake up.
this thing make me do all drugs in same time.... and put it on repeat...
Mazen Izzeddine why not both?
couldn't agree more . I never did . Just loved the music
never a truer word said........ early 00's off my tits on magic beans
Hovis has the right answer for this one....."best of both!" #tune
This song is amazing on drugs
My favorite music is gothic and alternative darkwave scene,but i really like a lot of electronica dance tracks like that and other good djs and of course i use to go in good events on my country greece.at 18 august mayby i ll go to see paul oakenfold in Athens.MDMA is perfect for mind and spirit.500 mg every week can cure the dipression,and make you better personality in your life.Doctors and farmacy industries are a good business for take you money for prozac,escitalopram and others fucking pills for make you a zompie.If the true come to the light and all learn that with MDMA,Marihuana and healthy food make the people absolute healthy then the farmacy industries going to boom boom.Its all about money guys.Only love!
drugs are bad but weed and lsd and mdma is good
BRAVO !
Drugs are bad mmkey?
Mazen Izzeddine qui social ăą) o o o 2 West l#lp%que p%@0a0rplas gas zahorí LG si kk d si Zafa Alzó are
drugs or the strings would have a similar effect on the brain chemistry, both done together is quite an experience, not saying it should be done, just saying lol
why do drugs when you can Adagio For Strings - You're a lucky man!
Mazen Izzeddine Everything is better on Ecstasy!
rachel Reed, totally agree with you
Used to do club drugs n listening to this now after a few beverages I feel like I'm high as a kite
why not both
That's what I have been thinking since 1997 :) - Almost anyway, not particularly this song, but techno in general. I dont need drugs, when the music pumps me up on its own.
Mazen Izzeddine pero si usas marihuana es mejor
Mazen Izzeddine u
ABSOLUTELY ;-)
Who lost the fcker?
you right man - adagio for strings is my drugs for ever - i miss old tiesto
Don't do drugs... Drugs are bad mmmmkayyyy!

The horror! This is a travesty. We can only be glad that mr Barber isnt here anymore . What an utter display of lack of talent this song is. Trully blessed are the ignorant

Thanks to mention the original soundtrack : Platoon.
John McMahon are you sure? Drugs were legal in those days.
Thanks to Samuel Barber. He made this music in the 1930's without any drugs.

This is horrible. Just like the theme from Clockwork Orange, you can&#39;t just take a moving classical piece and slam some tripled pads and 909 beats over it. It destroys the feeling the composer wanted just do somebody can go &#39;wow this is kinda deep and edgy&#39;

Samuel Barber-Adagio for strings
adagio for strings, de ahí el nombre de la canción de Tiesto
Pelos de punta!! Ke recuerdos 👏👏👏impresionante 
Kevin and Perry Go Large used this I swear
your spot on....
yea haha
Yeah, and when they got threw up on xD
that is how to destroy the beauty of this music ! very poooor
truely ace!!!!! The ONLY version I like of this. Tiesto is the king of this one. This got played 3 times at NYE sydney in 2003-2004. A Dj no, no but I didn&#39;t mind one bit. And it was played by the king himself.
if you would make a track like this in 2016 it would be considered as trash totally....
@Hareka Tysiri XD thank you.
i'll pay for that
I can't help but think of someone losing their mind in a futuristic world filled with lights and a forever dark sky where stars never shine because the lights are always on. Disconnectivity. It's tragic but beautiful because of the lights shinning off of their skin, their clothes...everyone is hypnotized to go on as they are and never find what's missing.
Just imagine a song like this in a movie.... Just imagine. I wish i was born 20 years earlier.
Hareka Tysiri im an agree
It would be awesome in a new movie though
sadly, yes.. people think its boring and monotone but, actually it's hypnotizing

you aint got a clue we listening to some of the best trance ever across all the genres
X. Breogán Costa L well said
Chema perez garcia aye thanks for the tip! I appreciate it :)
I'm Just a squid man, if you really want create good music gets a copy of ableton un pc, take a lots of class of production musical un youtube and your music its better
X. Breogán Costa L actually I've been a big fan of tiesto and I really admire his music. I've been making music for about a month now(it's not great trust me), but it's turning out great! If you want to listen to my music. Download Music Maker Jam and search up David Petillo Jr. That's where I make my music. I like making house, edm and sometimes I spice it up with a little bit of trap. Trust me.
Armin still does trance..
X. Breogán Costa L your so right!!!!!
i like it i love it
Tell him bro! the fucker doesn't know whats he talking about
Not true at all, you're just being fed mainstream media garbage. Dig a little deeper and you will find many a good trance and techno artist kicking about.
X. Breogán Costa L so true... :c
X. Breogán Costa L so true

True mann...
my favorite piece..
The number of people who do not seem to know that this is a Remix of &quot;adagio for strings&quot; by Samuel Barber (a classic played in movies such as Platoon and Elephant Man), is quite astonishing, and honestly, quite depressing too.
William Orbit has the best version of this music
There is a classical song named Samuel Barber - Adagio for strings - from which there was an excerpt made by William Orbit which was remixed by Ferry Corsten in 1999 ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4opHv2BG4fY). Tiesto's remake was made later and there's also a Mark Sixma remake (made even later).
william orbits 'adagio for strings' by samuel barber, remixed by tiesto..........ACTUALLY. lmao
http://www.whosampled.com/Ti%C3%ABsto/Adagio-for-Strings/
@TheMightyPoke​ No we both were wrong, he said it's sad because no one knew the original piece was written by Samuel Barber 
Jefferson Huang Theres literally nothing negative in OPs comment he just calls the song depressing because it is
No this is a remix of the classical piece by Samuel Barber, but our friend Adrian Tepes tries to bring misery to everyone else with such a negative comment. So, yeah, it's a misunderstanding.
lol there is nothing depressing in that and its not a remix... if you want just want thumbs up say something that makes sense
because that sounds like utter shit that is most likely why
I do love this tune
When you realised that Tiesto is now Collabing with Martin Garrix
sounds of the universe!!

@marksmanjack I can only say : Thank you.
Adagio for strings was composed in 1936 by Samuel Barber, so Platoon used it too, guess everyone needs a little help creating a melodies.....furthermore, so what... it sounds great.
This song is just an electrified copycat of Platoon OST. made by people unable to build their own melody.
For the structure is ripped from Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings. :D It makes a cover in ANY style sound good.
geiler sound 90er

the dj's job is to remixes songs

actually the song was created 80 years ago,he just remixed it. pretty good remix though.

Kvlt SAIF hahhahahaha 😂😂😂😂
literal same
Kvlt SAIF Sameee! lol this is good shit though. Eargasm ❤
Kvlt SAIF same here haha 😂😂
Well that might be fast kinda chaotic electronic. But then there is also super dark raw/electronic which may also resonate to somebody who might like different metal styles, in a different way yino. I'm thinking of low-fi house and dark acid techno
for the metal loving dudes check out gabber, terror core, crossbreed etc, I'm a big thrash fan and those genres mentioned above are the metal of the dance world
nice mayhem pic. I love black metal and grindcore... but sure fuck it, I love to party too!! this song is epic. Just to let you know there is plenty of electronic music as raw and dark as bm bands. check out a few I hate models tunes for example.
this isn't my favorite genre of music but this one is great
Aztaable Tiesto is not fucking techno.
Dude Tiesto was Trance, he's not Hardcore Techno. Metal isn't "Hardcore", that's a different genre.
RaginCajunAsian me too
I'm a big Metalhead and I know exactly why I'm here
Same
I listen to alot of music punk hiphop metal techno trance dubstep etc. If you look into a certain genre you will allways find something you like.
Dude me too. I'm a Thrash/Death/Black Metal fanatic. But I love raves, listening to Hardstyle, Techno, Trance, Hardcore, House, Industrial EBM/Techno and all their variations. I think a big part of what makes this human experience worth living is exploring the multitude of nuances that we are granted just by existing and having consciousness. Why CAN'T you deviate from one particular form of music? Listen to music for talent, not for genre.
that's exactly it, people who like these kinds of music appreciate artists that go "all ouT" and take their craft to new heights. Tiesto sure as shit did that for trance, and classic artists like Sabbath and Metallica did that for metal so, the overlap is real for me
trance is the betta
experience
you stopped sleeping with women that's why
Duude me 2 lol
haha me too but I enjoy trance music too XD
@***** oh so I'm just stupid, lol.
@***** Véletlenül, nem a Szondi-ba jártál suliba, Balassagyarmaton? :)
@Evikkted  No. The original song doesn't have BPM indication. Trance is usually range between 130-150 BPM, except some of it's even faster (200+ BPM) subgenres.
it had to match the BPM of the original song made by Samuel Barber, so that's why.
Tiesto was a trance producer, not hc techno. :D It's a trance song and this genre usually has high BPM compared to mainstream house music.
Yes......i really like this guy And a few other dj's as well Bt i just hate the modern pop shit 😝
I know many people who listen to HC rock,metal. But they also like to listen to HC techno too. Basically anything thats hard core :) Tiesto is HC techno so likely thats why it happened to be next in the list.
haahahaha same here, all metal! but i like thid guy too
his best of the best ;)
best song ever of all times of electro
good
I prefer the original
🆓🆒🔝👍
Golden years!!! 😅
2016 e essa musica ainda me faz eu me sentir insanamente bem
Creative but not as good as the original...
I remember pulling off the M56 down some country lane near Warrington, and banging some bird to the beat of this, next day some owl 1 who owned a B@B was telling me about the wind and the willows.
Just chipped a tooth
drugs ... drugs everywhere
hahaha get in there lad
muy buena
What were you on?? And where can i get some??
alejandro.......angelica where are you... angelllllllllll
I have absolute 90s on at work, the decade that was dance music and trance, never once heard this or pretty much any real dance music, plenty Oasis played daily though.
If you have never seen the film the Elephant man, this song is in it, well the original version is. welling up moment.

I remember myself listening to this song when I was like 7 y/o and an old woman telling my mom &quot;that kind of music is for gay people&quot;. I don&#39;t know why, but I just can&#39;t never forget that. How is this song gay?
because that woman isn't an EDM fan
Gay clubs typically only played stuff like this for a while.
lmao

You miss: DOTA - Basshunter
Sophie Miller infinity :)
Thanks man. Used your comment to find things i heard years ago, but never knew the name of hahaa
haya bud...whats the name of ur channel???
El Nino Polish DJ Kalwi & Remi great music and DJ. I am from Poland and I am their loyal fan and I really like trance and electronic music.
Then the same can be said for 2010's :/
(To some of the commenters) And if you seriously shitting on the 90's by saying 00's are superior at everything, you're in some serious trouble... 90's trance was pure classical raving, 00's and onward should not even compare. 90's football was fucking gold, 00's was merely a continuation seeing the players declining. 90's hip hop was hot as fuck, far more style than any of the Lil Uzi Vert or Migos bullshit (also, fuck 50 Cent's "In Da Club", it's only catchy and nothing more) 90's had a lot of good shits that some of us failed to enjoy.
xD
Sophie Miller your missing darude
00's was avesome :) i was 18 years old :)
yes those were the days :)

Sophie Miller what about cafe del mar
check out Quench Dreams 90's Chooooooon & Get Back To Me 😎
bad thingd
that list you have there makes med want to time travel back in time
Lucky for you you don't understand the words from "Dragostea din tei". They are soooo stupid that it makes you never wants to hear that song again. Maybe I am too old, but it is either a song without words, or a song with good lyrics. That "Dragostea din tei" was neither. And, btw, it is an innuendo about an old kids story with a bird in a tree. But the same word is used for stupid girls.
😍😘
dragostea din tei? lol mayaheee, mayahoooo, maya haha xD
Sophie Miller 😘
Hell yea. I still have some of these songs in my playlist. The other songs are also epic (maybe except the French ones)
Nope, that's just nostalgia.

@TheProjectX3 :)
some perfect list out there :)
the 00s > the 90s All the time Music: better (DnB & Trance Golden Era - Notable artists include: Pendulum, Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, The Prodigy) Games: better (Golden Era of RTS - Notable games include: Age Of Mythology, Age Of Empires 3, Red Alert 2, Rome: Total War, Medieval 2: Total War, Supreme Commander, etc.) The revolution of mp3 players, technology in general.
but, but the 90s are best! we had cool hip hop and, and music was better!
Heard this song when i was 7 years old. Now im 19 still one of my favorites songs. Nothing can beat this.
buparçalar dinleyene tur attırıyor
Baguette Stealer I agree with you!

Ana Simunic I think real anthem of trance is a Aurora Borealis The Milky way. What u think? 😉
Baguette Stealer I am almost 30 years old, and I can say this is really an Anthem...but there are a lot of good trance anthems...my suggestions is listen Chichane or Schiller. :D
shut the fuck Up
im 19 aswell, i grew up with this shit man, fuckin unreal
no one cares what you think......
Actually.. i think u shouldnt call it a song... i think it should be called a track :P
.
+jordi de wolf... very cool memories! all the best.
Just found this song now and it's already in my top 5.
i was lucky enough to have my parents own a dancing/bar in belgium, i heard it and saw it all from my 5th till 13th year in this world... growing up with that music, something i will never forget, i remember hearing this song when i had to go in my bed, faintly feeling the bass... the melodies coming trough the floor like a faint lullaby... i feel lucky
I heard it when I was 9 years old by my brother because I haven't listened nothing at those years but today I remember this when I listen this and only can say that this is awesome
I heard it when i was like 8 years old.. now i'm 18 and i think i just broke the replay button :D
Pareil :) on avait tous un bon grand frère ou parent :p
same for me
I know your feel bro

Is there any more of an iconic Trance tune, than this? My fave of all time &lt;3
Tiesto in his prime was well..... the best.

Legendary song.
i think it can be the crysis them song from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=3m45s">3:45</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=4m22s">4:22</a> ❤
That part is really just the composition Adagio for Strings.
platoon movie soundtrack
Brasil 2016
When you in the Club partying hard and you get Vietnam Flashbacks.
Lol
In the end the war wasn't against the enemy, it was against ourselves.
People that saw the movie platoon get this, everybody else is lost
Was we in the same platoon cos I do the same 🤔
For those who don't get the joke this song is a remix of theme of platoon. A war film set during Vietnam
Stuart McPhee b dance drink ditto
@obamer 5 seconds.
@Dale Blackburn That's deep.
RIP sergeant Elias. I swear I didn't nearly cry
@Neptunes Express Does it exist, for Veterans? I know this from Full Metal Jacket

@Thái Dương you weren't around when that shit happened
@Jason Oliveira ITS A WONDERFUL F*KING WAR !!!!
@moses appleby And I'm shocked at how many people do not try to explain this to the uninformed. Now it makes sense.
aww we got an Nva Regular here. !! Get him
@Winicjusz_Plastelina he only went to cadets. Marched around.. then bragged about his service.. hilarious
@Anjali Chandna ahhh shiiittt gets real...
Lt. WOLF still waiting to get drunk and be sexually taken advantaged of...hahaha

@Thái Dương di di di.
Hey, aren't you from modern talking?
so distasteful..smh........
When you in club penguin partying hard and you get cold war flashbacks
@Thái Dương You won though :D
Can still smell the Napalm now.. best breakfast ever.
@Domas Junelis war tíz éra =&=j:h db b hp p ops Ljubljana jj jól Ljubljana ip assembly k
I was only 5 when the war ended, so no, I don’t get flashbacks. Not even from “Platoon” ha ha.
When your Grandpa shows up at the rave drunk asf and randomly starts dancing
Dude.
Dieter Bohlen Nice...Lmao
president wouldnt fight for you so ....
It's alright though. I was born in 74 that means I'm 16 in 1990 I'm so glad I was a 90s child. All klu Dup Crew ;)🇬🇪
What we got here is a crusader
This music makes me sleepy but not asleep and totally focus. If i had a 44 mags i will definitely shoot bulls eye on my target
That means this music is too strong for you. You get distress. Be careful for suicide.
You spent tooo much Time at Little Bear Records LoL...
@Thái Dương it was a movie about war...in which 40mins of the soundtrack was this track
Thats a good meme
lmao
When you are in club in singapore full of china people and suddenly dj plays teisto .
It did make me giggle a bit...x :)
@Thái Dương Adagio for STRINGS, the clue is in the title, and the STRING version featured in the film Platoon set during the Vietnam war.
platttttttoooooooonnnn
Projekt x
I'm shocked how many people did not get that joke. It's the theme tune from platoon- Vietnam war movie.
+Lorne Malvo they mean the tragic and moving scene of sgt Elias's death in Platoon.try to look it out
Before Platoon, Adagio for Strings was used in the movie Lorenzo’s Oil.
Allison Stoddard /It is a One Love tune tho innit, Good choice to get done by xx😍😆
Chingonaaa!!! Esto es trance ...
THEY GOT ELIAS!!!

Ralph A this comment is unbeatable
Marko Bonacin boo.. it's Chris !!!! Come on get it right Barnes !!!
When you see Charlie :)))
Y Vaz for fuck sake platoon is a movie based in the Vietnam war and the song is featured in a scene and this is a popular club tune
Vietnam flashback? Then I have no idea what are you doing in a club!
Insiminia
I'll explain in the movie the song is used in a certain scene so let's say a character from there 10 years later in a club partying and this song comes on the flashbacks it was a joke and a pretty fucking good one have none of you seen platoon?
Ralph you weren't there man, you weren't there, don't talk Nam unless ya were there!
Sarah Laureys What?
JACA = PRACA
that hot girl on ur youtube prfile :o *-*
I came here after watching the cat who had a flashback
Oliver Draathelvete what he means is, if you have ever had a moment where you stare into space, for instance you're working at a desk, you look out the window and find yourself just starring into nothing, now pull your soul out of your body and look back at yourself and play this music.
Oliver Porter oi i was in cramps too bahaha😂😂🤣
Sergeant Elias would have been ecstatic for this. Staff Sergeant Barnes would have shot everybody.

no is not..i'm from Macedonia.. if u know . if not. i will not be surprised.how ever i never learn English in school . we learn french .most english i was learn was from movies .
English isn't your first language, is it pal?
What song is this? original music
Sorry I don't know that one. I know there has been a ton of classical songs and samples used in trance, but the only other ones I remember at the moment are Tiesto - Athena which used Albinoni's Adagio in G minor and Freon - Heavens gate which used the choir from Allegri: Miserere mei, Deus.
+Slaskhask dude can you help me find a song?! I thought it was this one (adagio for strings) but it isn't the other classical theme is called "scheherazade" its just the violin part.. I know I've heard it somewhere by someone else.. He or she uses this sample but I don't remember ):
Samuel Barber - Adagio for strings
אני רגיל להיות בפרונט
ולא כולם אוהבים לדבר על הסוגיות שאני מעלה כאן אני משתדל לבחור תצד הנכון

'eyy mate cheers from .. LEBANON too c:
+hugonore lmao
You're lucky in Lebanon, summer can last five years...
Did you know that the original is &quot; William Orbit - Barber&#39;s Adagio For Strings&quot;, and the Ferry Corsten remix of that is as good as Hell? :-))<br><br>(I love both Tiesto&#39;s and that one, this tune is amazing!!!!!)<br><br>Have a very nice day, everyone! :-))
samuel barber creat this piece of music (adaigo for strings) William orbit i think he make it choir
I'm not the one who posted that info, it was Viktoria above. But, to answer your question, search for the song and find out! " William Orbit - Barber's Adagio For Strings",
+DrewUniverse So the signature song is just a cover version of an.orchestral piece?!
I didn't know, thanks Victoria! This is one of the most signature songs we have in Trance/EDM to date. I'll check out the original and the Ferry Corsten version~
no matter how old this gets, it is still truly amazing.
Tiesto played this one at Kingsday, was so thankfull he did it! Best track from Tiesto ever made, hell maybe even best trance track ever made. Had goosebumps all over my body.
His new style sucks btw, same for Armin van Buuren.
Varsa Şekerin Patlayalım Şekerim
The real tiesto is this .. Trance is dead :(
Artifac No need to FEAR when VINI VICI is HERE...!!!!
+Dhinesh Denson well watch him in Belfast when we party we fucking party
Trance already made a comeback.... W&W with NWYR project, Arty with Alpha 9, Sander Van Doorn with Purple Haze... Tiesto is yet to make a comeback but i am sure he will soon...
Try the Thrillseekers. Trance is making a comeback in Florida.
never... trance never die.. actually i listen trance Music..
I know some good trance songs that aren't that old
Yeah adagio for strings is best
yeah he could put something like Barbers remix into the name but what the hell? this song is perfection amongst its genre.
im listening trance every fucking day.
The real Tiesto was before 2004, 1999 up to 2002 I would say was his better days
ibiza trance....what about higher state of consciousnesses by josh wink, thats original trance mate.

זה כבר פוגע בי נפשית מזל שאני חזק
Music Choice channel brought me here, while playing Counter Strike: Source.....back in 2008....yeehaw nostalgia.
Back when tiesto was good. I&#39;m hoping his new venture in deep house is better because his big room songs sucked.
whether its deep house or trance, tiesto doesn't produce his songs anyway
no he was already going downhill here, best Tiesto era was from 1999 to 2003
I love this song is fantastic I think that he is the best Dj because he can to do the best mixes. Sorry If I was wrong But I am learning english.
you are doing well! good job. just a few mistakes. "I love this song, it is fantastic. I think that he is the best DJ because he can make the best mixes."
y por que no esta apertura?ibiza espera
fantastica
Complete crap
GREAT
It&#39;s like somebody made a cheeseburger out of Filet Mignon.
The original song, by Samuel Barber. It sounds really freaking sad.
The original what?
i agree but if you use quality ingredients it's still delicious
Very well said, James.
He probably means the original got butchered, which I wholeheartedly agree with. What a bunch of shite.
+TheStigSP joedson
I feel like it gave it more pulse. The original damn near made me cry. This makes me want to get work done. Heroin vs cocaine?
I like the both sides a lot but was a great compairson hahaha
Its an old track , tracks of that time were not as well produced than now
tiesto the king!

this beat will be nice when the world is ending or a after mass of a earthquake
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=4m00s">4:00</a> did he rip this straight from Homeworld, or did Homeworld take it from him?
Good informative post Tim, thanks =) We all cant know all details of every piece of music ever created =)
+Baleur Knowing that you are talking about the number 1 DJ of the world . Take a guess :)
+Baleur The both ripped it from Samuel Adagio. . . From Wikipedia: Adagio for Strings is a work by Samuel Barber, arguably his best known, arranged for string orchestra from the second movement of his String Quartet, Op. 11. Barber finished the arrangement in 1936, the same year that he wrote the quartet. It was performed for the first time in 1938, in a radio broadcast from a New York studio attended by an invited audience, conducted by Arturo Toscanini, who also took the piece on tour to Europe and South America. Its reception was generally positive, with Alexander J. Morin writing that Adagio for Strings is "full of pathos and cathartic passion" and that it "rarely leaves a dry eye."[1] The music is the setting for Barber's 1967 choral arrangement of Agnus Dei. Adagio for Strings can be heard in many TV shows and movies. Adaptations[edit] Barber's choral setting, Agnus Dei, can be heard in the soundtrack to the PC video game Homeworld, released in 1999.[29] The work is extremely popular in the electronic dance music genre, notably in trance.[30] Artists who have covered it include William Orbit,[31] Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren,[32] Tiësto, Mark Sixma, Bastille and Arnej. eRa included this song in their album Classics.[33]

epic. my children times....
Trance Legend...
Did you all know that this is a remix/copy? The real original is from 1999, by William Orbit.
@yaTonop I clearly remember listening a certain Ferry Corsten's set when whe opened with a remix of S. Barber - problably the  one you mencioned.... but I assumed it was a remix of Tiesto's lol. thanks for pointing that out.
+Jack Beckman In fact, "the dance/rave original" was produced by Ferry Corsten, who remixed William Orbit's rendition of S. Barber's original tune) Which I find much better, as Corsten's version managed to preserve the mood of the original, while the version by Tiesto is purely a dance track, more aggressive I should say
@3TTriple Yeah that's true. I meant the dance/rave original, which Tiesto has remixed/drawn inspiration from.
+Jack Beckman The original is from Samuel Barber - Adagio for strings aka Plattoon Theme
love this song.
its sade becuse it reminds of platoon. great movie
dont forget the tune !
Oh Man, the era when Tiesto was the undisputed Trance Mix Behemoth. I miss these days..
Kurwaaaaaaa jazdaaaaaaa

I cant find the lyrics
at the height of his creativity before he just went along with whatever was popular at the time. put his spin on a classic beautiful song and really let his ability shine through. they should play this shit cranked up to 11 at a brooklyn warehouse rave. with or without the drugs, everyone will be bumpinggg
I still love this.
Still gold...

+Gabriel Esper gold ? Gold is like every other metals. But this has only one. Unique

Listen to the original.
Pitiful... Fucking loser who can&#39;t even be bothered to adhere to the original concept. A 4 bar clown with no comprehension of music.... What a joke.

Tiësto in the chelo x&#39;D
who&#39;s here coz of 1980s the Elephant man?
old tiesto is still so much better than his new shit
kkkkk
Thank you for Gustav Mahler.
Listening to Tiesto Creamfields 2006 playing off vinyl, the crowd was mental. A time before raves became festivals. Now when tiesto plays a thousand mobile phones video it while stood still. As soon as phones came on the scene it was game over for the scene. Not interested now.
this is not tiesto theme,a composer named samuel barber composed it long time ago..the original is beautifull..

SHEER GENIUS
all time classic
One of the greatest song i have ever heard. Thanks to Samuel Barber for releasing but Tiesto&#39;s work is of a genius! Any further rework will make it sick. 😆
\m/
tiesto not fitted musicaly that work! filter separations bad! not only my opinion! sorry! I not understand what that represent! I feed my analyzers to talk about rawnes and not musical linearyty in freqens spectrum. all is distorted a bit! mr. tiesto what is your prioryti?! :-)<br>you play in Bratislava? if yes I remember that ewent! sorry total fault! :&#39;(
insane!
Cool

I so love this, I lost my sister to ovarian cancer and this was our tune., love you so much Siobhan and keep partying my beaut of a sister. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OLD BUT GOLD
this is tiesto !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Samuel barber, besides rotting, is wondering what the fuck is all that ornamd entation about on what I wrot? Why do they need this to make it cool??<br>Thing is he&#39;s dead now so I guess it doesn&#39;t matter. <br>Personally I can think of better ways to re-imagine it. <br>This version is just /// IDK, kinda just goofy, and embellishing for the moment, not for - as sam planned it - for eternety. It <b>is</b> one of my favorite go to morbid musics.
This is one of my favorite Trance songs of all time for how they made the tune much more happy to the original.

Ce titre est une merveille, tiesto au sommet de son art ! Ce morceau de musique classique mis à la sauce éléctronique est renversant ; au début quand le son monte créchendo, j&#39;en ai des frissons partout ... que d&#39;émotions. Bien que cela ne soit &quot;que&quot; de la musique éléctronique, il n&#39;est pas peu dire quand certaines personnes disent que Dieu s&#39;exprime par la musique que peuvent créer les Hommes .....

super šepa za nas starije na jonkasdima booooo.....haahahahaah
I like to run with this song. Always dead tired when the song is done: this song makes you run faster than you want to!
@kurt koben with death comes knocking you do the impossible. I run 6 miles a day. 5 1/2 minute miles. All day everyday. I don’t and I die even sooner
Weak😂
Oh shit im somking weed😒
@kurt koben i
The energy is like a redbull
@l Mc Music is always there even without you hearing it if you've got a musical ear though.
I used to dance in clubs 'til they closed to music like this.
@AlmightyArjen Of course it will. Adrenaline will help you run faster. THere is of course a limit to how much more capacity that someone gains from it, but it sure is more than 10%.
100% mate. I always put this on at the end of a race and start flying past everyone else running lol
5@Safa Hagui
Try "Mane Sonitus" by Hibernate. It's becoming epic when choir comes at the scene.
Safe 👍🤫
@kurt koben 00
mount baldy! That's funny. Who gives a shit what you run.....
Me2!! This song just happened to play randomly in my run and i was so pumped
@kurt koben ppppppppppp
0000000⁰00000000000000⁰ppp
@kurt koben ⁰⁰⁰00⁰⁰0⁰pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
You think this is fun but i think youre stupid .
When I am feeling tired, and about to give up in the middle of my cardio , I play this song , it gives me so much energy, and reminds me that i cant give up.
@kurt koben atp 90 sec
The first round look lfor L L
Agree, I just finished running to this song, very upbeat and energetic, gave me that extra pump in my run.
@kurt koben I would imagine if man was chasing me with chainsaw it would slow him down. 50% should cut it.
its realy good with MDMA but without mdma i dont listen . İ prefer elepphant man soundtrack
@kurt koben аппп
So are when did you die last
It's not a song 🤣 there is 0 singing 🤣
@Chris Oakes The man speaks the truth bro.
Cool story bro
@l Mc then you sing oosh oosh while running
@kurt koben time is not relative to intensity. You need to train more..
@Madmads007 Satan confirmed.,
Play eurobeat instead.
I used to run 5km 4 days a week listening to trance. This music gives you energy to keep going even your body wants to stop. Edit: Actual I it was 10km not 5 I used to run for an hour at a fast pace not slow jog.
@martin nielsen in
Soooooo true
@kurt koben try this one once in a while: https://youtu.be/oN7qFFq3ymQ 😉🙃
P
Yea..”RUNNING” 😅
@l Mc Lol fuck off. If music helps me run I'm using it. Why wouldn't you? It's a free boost.
@kurt koben u zg z
@l Mc Relax, it’s not war.💥....yet 😄
@AlmightyArjen Good.. very Clever..!!
Correctttoo
Pues nada yo aquí con una primicia el temazo de Dj Tiesto..https://youtu.be/siJaiEqcCNo Si os gusta darle al Like y por supuesto podéis compartirla
its energetic you say , I agree
@almightyarjen I admire your efforts! This track makes you run faster because the beat causes your heart rate to react psychologically.
@l Mc You can't even separate your sentences or come up with a mature argument without cussing. Please leave the internet and don't post anymore idiotic comments.
@AlmightyArjen qq
Thats pussy shit! Running with music is cheatin what happens when you need music and its not there.
Thats called dopamine man, lol
nobody is singing... it's not a song
@AlmightyArjen j
Thank you tiesto
@AlmightyArjen I run a mountain called mount baldy here in cali 45 minutes run 6 miles up starting at 4000 feet elevation to 12000 championship shit try doing it for 30nseconds feels like weights all over your muscles gasping for air but i push and push and push my soul is on fire i push and remember I want to make it for my family for everyone in this world and this song plays in my mix. Boxing life
+AlmightyArjen Why not, it would be some nice times thats for sure =)
+kurt koben I see new possibilities for the Olympics, a new race that is called "use whatever means necessarry to run as fast as you can". Guys with chainsaws or zombies on dope would undoubtedly make an athlete run faster :D
Run at 95% speed for 7 minutes, that i want to see before i belive it unless you run on dope or are chased by a man with chainsaw :P Yea i tought of jog.
+kurt koben depends how fast you are running.
@kurt koben Go and run at 95% and see if you're capable to do it for 7 minutes...
+AlmightyArjen You die after running ~7 min? You should work on your condition i think.

This song is actually part of the soundtrack for the game DEFCON
well, being a farewell tune it would make perfect sense, it was played at Albert Einsteins funeral (although not the Tiesto version)
and the horse it rode in on.
Be a good tune to just listen and head bang to before you die

Hi, I&#39;m just another guy who is trying to create music. If you have a few seconds to look at my channel I got a couple of songs that might interest you. So go ahead and enjoy it! Any response will be good for me. Thank you for your time.
soy fanático de skrillex., esta electrónica me encanata mucho
Red Square Adelaide took me back here hahahahahahahahahahaha
OMD!!<br>(y) &lt;3
oooh so this song is basicly just a remix ... I wondered that tiesto never could&#39;ve thought out such a melody.
Video from 2008, so high quality.
I was 14 when i listened to this...Holy shit i just time traveled!
The 1st time listening to EDM was this song growing up playing strings {violin} I was memorized. My journey with music began :)
the best song of tiesto definitely of all time
OMG I was like 9 years old and this blew up for the first time here in Brazil! Every radio was playing that so hard and everyday, it was like the first trance to became famous after the explosion of Eurotrance here, i&#39;m sooooooo fuckin&#39; old!
is awesome <b>-</b>

Dj tiesto is oringinally from Turkey, his real name is Dj Osman but 10 years ago i said to Dj Osman it&#39;s better if you change your name and your oringinally. And Justin Bieber is originally from Iran but also he change his name. His real name is Jabbar Ahmet Sheiks Abdoel Chaffaar. Long live Turkey greetings from Zimbabwe.

unfortnlt. im agree that ... B the way oldies but goldies...
+Cem Yusufoglu was. now he went to garbage house scene
I&#39;ve had some misconceptions about Tiesto and thought he focused on Big Room(which I believe to be 100% garbage. Is he primarily a trance dj?
It&#39;s such a fucking disgrace that people think tiesto made the melody. Half these fuck heads don&#39;t even know this is a classical song remixed. Look up the original for fucks sake. I personally don&#39;t like this version at all but as a classical bass player I can say it&#39;s insulting that people give no credit to the original composer and are completely ignorant of the original songs existence
+RuinedPk3rs Sad that this version has more views that the original...
@RuinedPk3rs to me Tiesto show up first, and i just tried it. i usually type just artist name, then i randomly choose a track, and then i listen other tracks of same artist from recommended
Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber. Its the first thing that comes up when you type in adagio for strings. I honestly have no idea how you could even miss it
okk...tell me who is the original composer..?
+RuinedPk3rs it's not disgrace when you don't know. not everyone are knowledgeable like you to know it's a remix. i've never seen anyone or anywhere say it's remix of X track besides you, and i don't know the original track, so i thought it's oiginal track
Pure trance &lt;3
miss old tiesto classics..........
Good night man in the suitcase...

<b>***</b> nagyon jó 
tiesto should listen to this again
jak w operze :)
You can tell he loaded the midi file for Sam Barber&#39;s Adagio for strings into a generic synth pad and called it a song
dam this song is insane! I love it
B4 he sold out.... If you think otherwise your to damn young to know better or your American.
+Whatisgame ive met him twice and he's a right dick thinks he's the bee's knee's... but the tune is GREAT
+Potaka79 You do realize this is based off a piece by an American yes? But you are right though.
I'm American and this was the first Tiesto track I ever heard..way back. By the way, though I love a lot of his stuff, he's an egomaniac and a prick. He really was a db to a friend that was djing before he went on.

can&#39;t stop coming back 2thus track... tiesto&#39;s golden days
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
It&#39;s a great mix, ok lots of memories for the old version as in william orbit but i&#39;m old and started raving to techno in 93 progressing to house, hard house, and early trance(all 3 genres combined to make trance i believe). So old tunes with a darker stompy influence i love. Music has changed i love old and new stuff dark techno elements combining with supremely uplifting breakdowns melodies and synths are awesome. I love all trance-and i&#39;m working towards recording some mixes that i hope will push the boundries of trance combining old and new stuff trance is trance-love it or hate it
The truth is that when Ferry remixed Adagio For Strings, he did it too well. Ferry&#39;s version is outstanding piece of trance history while this was just a sad cash-in. At the time this came out, TIesto had already jumped off the wagon. It saddens me that this horrible piece of sh*t is topping the search results for &quot;adagio for strings&quot;.
Great song for music lovers! I mean ecstacy users ..
I don&#39;t think those 1466 ignorant people actually heard this song right...

Well i can understand why he left, money, its ok, but i think he got enough of it now for the rest of his and his family lives, now the question - why he choose to stay, maybe he just does not feel that trance is for him? Maybe he got tired of it or lost all his uniqueness and cant do proper track anymore? HOLY shit i was writing this comment and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a> kicked in, this is unbelievable, how great he was..

no coment, music talking...
Still gives me goosebumps to this day.
Tiesto is still the best. He&#39;s a maestro of trance. Garrix, Hardwell, come as students of Tiesto. Tiesto still has the best songs no matter what. Now all you haters, shut the fuck up.
+Siddhanth Vinay half naked chicks is better than fully clothed sweaty men thinking that tiesto is the best and anyone that says otherwise is wrong
@James Lawrence because they had semi naked chicks walking around with Ipads in festivals like tomorrowland getting people to vote for them.. Have you seen the list? There's a DJ Alok, above the legend Eric Prydz, whose gotten standing ovations for 5 minutes after his sets and that just removes any credibility this list has 
Ok mush, keep believing that.... Its fans vote.. End of!
+James Lawrence dj mag is of little relevance when Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike are number 1
That's cute considering Hardwell and Martin Garrix are number 2 and 3 DJ's in the world according to the DJ Mag Top 100. So shut the fuck up you nob head
What ever happened to the old legend, Tiesto!?
piękna piosenka mi nic nie przeszkadza że jest stara
oh I&#39;m old nowback day, in 2009 when I was go to club.the DJ played this song and I was kinda like&quot;Holy Shit, this song being played.. so many THANKS DJ&quot;

hey gente armeselo jajajaja
I m diing.
who said I was laughing ne mozes mi nista smijem se!!!!
very overrated tune
People saying this song destroyed the original, but in my opinion, is not destroyed, the song just got more rhythm. I like classic version and this version, there&#39;s nothing bad about liking both versions. This song still is a bit sad.
Both shouldn't even be compared
Yes I agree with you
+Isaac Rushworuuytvbb
+Isaac Rushworth I think they mean william orbit original
The original as the Samuel barbers original piece?
This is awful, way to completely destroy the original Adagio for Strings.
+YtubeUserr haha 😂 Really it has its own beauty but Tiesto nailed it. Perfect! 👌 Any further rework will spoil its beauty.
Forget guys... keep the calm and listen music. CI^_^D
Guys, I think I get it why some of you are upset. Your psychological problem might be that you have placed a piece of music (Adagio Strings) on a very high pedestal. This is the false, egotistical, dogmatic belief. And according to that dogma, anyone who expresses a dislike for Adagio Strings is a philistine/degenerate. This is the musical equivalent of racial superiority. You get absolutely triggered when someone makes unkind comments about Adagio Strings. So, besides looking into the genre intolerance/arrogance thingy, you might also benefit by asking yourself, "Why have I wrongly placed a particular piece of music on such a high pedestal?" Remember, it's not the fall from the pedestal but the pedestal itself that is the psychological problem.
@Dee Vee I'll meditate deeply on your comments; I might get enlightenment. But for the moment I'm going to go with, "you are just plainly wrong and did not understand the previous comments". Thanks for posting.
@YtubeUserr Your calling the original shit is also written down.
@Dee Vee The "accusation" is based on solid written-down evidence. You can choose to be blind. I won't blame you. Go ahead.
@YtubeUserr I can see your point, but dismissing a piece that clearly some people adore as shit, doesn't necessarily sound like 'dislike.' To classify it so negatively is judgement rather than opinion, which is really what you were accusing him of in the first place.
@Dee Vee Disliking something and expressing what you like as "superior taste" are totally different. One is normal dislike and the other is blatant, intolerant, arrogance into the faces of other people. I merely thought the following should be spoken against (ignore the grammatical errors): "Its classical music that actually sounds good to a person with good taste in music, not this awful shit thats called trance."
@YtubeUserr That's not what I said. I said you can dislike a genre, in the same way as you dislike a song. 
+Joe Albano Well, listen only to what you like. Thank you for your apologize. it was a great discussion. This is so funny. jajaja xD That's so funny xD
@Dee Vee Disliking a song = disliking a genre? Nonsense.
@YtubeUserr Saying 'this piece of music sucks balls' is along the same line as saying 'this genre of music sucks balls.' Its just your opinion, and if someone says they think trap is shite, that's no less correct than you saying adagio for strings sucks.
@Nar Comic Underworld I don't see his apology as a sign of weakness or defeat or inferiority. I also don't take it as a sign of some kind of perverse moral superiority or strength. You are spot on about "We've all been there (and guilty of doing it ourselves)".
@Joe Albano Non of us here can cast a stone for that bud. We've all been there (and guilty of doing it ourselves). It's all good. The fact that you felt the impulse to apologize for it, separates your from many who don't.  Shine on dude.
Im just going to apologize for insulting other peoples music choices, I was kind of heated the night I posted it.
@Dee Vee "a piece of music" is not the same as a genre is it? Think before you post, please.
+YtubeUserr You talk about genre intolerance but before you wrote ' I haven't heard a piece of music that sucked more than that. The original sucks balls really hard.' Pretty hypocritical.
@Joe Albano He is all right, but you are not at the moment. 1) How about stopping being a snob as he says? 2) How about addressing the twin diseases of genre intolerance and genre arrogance that has afflicted you? 3) How about getting you head out of your arse and stop making idiotic statements like "Its classical music that actually sounds good to a person with good taste in music"? 4) How about understanding the truth that other genres are in no way inferior?
@Nar Comic Underworld that was honestly deep.
As an eclectic music lover, I gotta say, dividing ourselves over taste in music is very limiting and pointless.  I love classical music, but even as a self deprecating individual, I don't really think of myself a snobby person. I love all sorts of music (especially trance/electronica/ambient, etc) and through that experience alone, I really believe you can come very close to the mystery behind life, not as a direct answer to it but a bridge towards something revolving around it. Yeah, there are snobs out there but a snob can be a snob over anything. A snobby person to me, is no different than a mental patient of lesser degree. Something made them into snobs. Usually ignorance causes it.  The worst thing that can happen is for a "snob" to infect you and make you no different than them in a different form or channel.  The questions one should ponder are...what do you like or are opened to experience and why or why not? Classical music is an amazing phenomena of human arts. Electronic music is also an amazing phenomena.  Of course there are always amazing pieces and not so amazing or evenly fleshed out works that one would have to weed through.  I think it's worth the effort...
+ElectRicardus He can't keep calm! He suffers from the twin diseases of genre intolerance and genre arrogance. Classical music is followed by HENs. HENs = Highly Egotistical Nerds. These people are blind to their own sense of faulty beliefs and false arrogance. They have a super-strong erroneous belief that all other genres are inferior.
+Joe Albano Keep the calm. The trance music is Characterized by taking influences from classical music. In contrast With other styles like the current house music or with few notes. You should be thankful That there is an electronic musical style like few others, trying to be melodic. Well. There are many better than this song anyway and originals. Greetings from chile.
@YtubeUserr Its classical music that actually sounds good to a person with good taste in music, not this awful shit thats called trance.
@YtubeUserr  My apologies.. this message wasn't intended for you at all. This was directed towards EpicEverythingDude's brash response. For some reason, I lumped you with him and thought I saw you caving in on Joe for sharing his opinion.  Disregard it as I edit my original reply.  It was early morning and had a knee jerk reaction. Forget about it. 
@Nar Comic Underworld Insult? Where?
nevermind.
@Nar Comic Underworld It's amazing that degenerates like yourself would call others degenerates. lol
+Joe Albano forget about it.
+Joe Albano I listened to the "original" after I read your comment and by god I haven't heard a piece of music that sucked more than that. The original sucks balls really hard.
@Joe Albano Why don't you research what trance music is as a genre before making stupid comments?
@EpicEverythingDude75 First off, why are you so edgy? Second, I don't only listen to classical music, take more things into account before losing your mind on the internet. Aside from that, I still think this shouldn't even be called music, its disorienting.
+Joe Albano The William Orbit version is a lot better, he did it well before Tiesto made this
+Joe Albano no not awful just a different style, good music will always attract mimics but in the end the original will find its way into their heatrs
makes me wanna grow some freaking wings a go flying in space...
NICEEEEEEE BETTER !!
Jealous if anyone ever experienced this during his live set back in the day. How amazing is this track?
this is when tiesto was awesome!! I remember hearing this in the clubs in 2000 and the crowd went crazy!!
EPIC!!! GENIUS AND FOREVER EPIC!
Shitty Mix, Ferry&#39;s was by far the best.
Tiësto &gt; Samuel Barber
Best song of all time!
pour mon beau pere
tiestö
Good!! 
Still one of my favorites.
AAMMAAZZIINNGG!!!!!!
This style of trance is today (2015) something like classic beethoven symphony......<br>With one exception that electronic sound is better even today.<br>If you listen some electronic songs from 1996-2005 you will be mind blowing from what we &quot;grow&quot; or what we left.<br>Some call that evolution in music, music evolution, i call it music/tase degeneration.
so many memories to this
I PLAY ALL THE TIME THAT SONG ON 2008 EVERYBODY HANDS UP!!!!

como es que no vi esto antes?
the best !!!!
Master piece...
this is pure druuuuuuuuug MISSING THE OLD tiesto
FUCK YEAH, been looking for this song for years
Tiesto didnt become bad<br>New generations are getting worst n worst taste in music.
Music changes over time. If it didn't we'd still be beating on rocks and sticks lol. No but seriously... It evolves, even if you like it or not. Just like the language; wether you like it or not, it changes. You wouldn't understand a word from the English that was first spoken. Everything evolves for a good cause, without it we wouldn't evolve. We wouldn't have all the technology we have nowadays, we wouldn't have all the geniuses that have wen't through our generations.
+Koolombo Loloso Nah Tiesto is definitely hard garbage. Guy is a poser and a fake. But this is a tune for all-time.
@Terr0rMKD Haha omg you guys are clueless
+Ethics404 hes right tho, i liaten to nowdays music/crap and like it but tracks like these will live forever
+Koolombo Loloso I'm sure most of you who thinks like this had parents thinking the very same. But when they told you, when you were into Trance, you thought they were wrong because that music was a thing back then. Your kind of music has passed, no one cares about old trance anymore because it has evolved. Live with it
+Koolombo Loloso Jesus shut up about that generation bullshit and just listen to the fucking song
not true
You understood nothing probably, if i said nothing then why offend me?
@***** You said nothing actually.
+Z.O.E. Go back to your Miley butthole, Kim kardashian and Justin barbier m8
+Freya Valentine Grammar?
+TheDinorhino born in the wrong generation guy
+TheDinorhino as the same way as art, music is subjective and everyone sees, hears and feels music differently but that do not allows you to talk in that way from what you dislike, i mean you hear what you like and you are happy, there is no need to come here and say that the music i like and a lot of other people like its bad or saying that our music tastes are getting worst with every generation, so please dont talk trash about what you dont Fucking Know :)
+Koolombo Loloso 2016 generation will be so awful . :) i have to say its all beacuse of facebook ..
+Koolombo Loloso Tiesto has never been all that great, to begin with. He is just an overrated icon of the early EDM scene, nothing more than a brand nowadays. He's also had some tracks ghost produced for him, for whatever reason that was (hard to believe he doesn't have some spare time for his, supposedly, main job. But, at the end of the day, everybody has their own opinion and that's fine.
+HeadStab nobody says that shut the fuck up
+Koolombo Loloso taste = opinion
+TheDinorhino Do you have any idea how many kids like you say that? "I should have been born in x year music these days suck" and then the other hipster kids upvote the comment and everything goes to shit. Never say this crap again, you look like a sheep and a child (which you are but I guess you're trying not to look like one).
+Koolombo Loloso Bad, worse/worst is not a way to describe music taste, music taste differs in everyone, music evolves in its own ways, all kinds of songs exist anytime, but what differs is the amount of attention a specific genre is given by the Media. So i say let everyone listen to whatever they like, and you listen to what you like :). Have a nice day
Memories man
Kozak na maxa!!!<br>I cale zycie z tym do przpdu;)

Legendary Melody of Tiesto..

Aż ciarki przechodzą &lt;3 TIESTOOO &lt;3
un verdadero exito que recordare para toda mi vida esto si era musica electro trance
What a tune I really miss those days they were the best
Fuck the  independent music shit, why has it overtaken this stuff? This was when music was good! I miss hearing it in clubs, miss the whole scene.
so so good. love it. waaay better than than the original.
Great Melody wow.
Turkiye burdamiiiii?
Much respect to Samuel Barber, what a beautiful thing music is
Fucking Legendary, So is this, Wow, Music brings out every emotion known to exist and I'm glad for it
'Agnus Dei, I believe it is called, the piece Samuel Barber wrote. That is the music used by Tiësto.
+Xenous Prime : or maybe we grew up and realised there is a trough beginning. Like you said the original is a great tune. Tiesto took it to a new plot. We don't know where is it going next.
+andy mcghee You will learn to understand Shakespeare when listening to its Klingon original too.
@cheryl hepworth  I was being sarcastic. The original is a masterpiece in my opinion.
+cheryl hepworth I was being tongue-in-cheek. But, like you, I prefer the original. Hands down.
+cheryl hepworth William Orbit did an amazing job. He managed to retain the emotional aspect of the piece while adding riveting synths over to really accentuate the energy. I'm no music expert, so please excuse my explanation.
+andy mcghee I think you might mean William Orbit's version, but yes - I agree! This is a little harder and loses some of the emotion.
+RobTi I think you might mean William Orbit's version, but yes - I agree! This is a little harder and loses some of the emotion.
+andy mcghee I wholeheartedly agree. Barber's cover of Tiesto's adagio for strings is my favorite version as well.
+xdeadstepx I actually prefer Barber's cover version to DJ Testio's original.
+shootingcows The original is named Adagio in G Minor. The one from Barber is performed in B flat Minor. Giazotto claimed to have written the complete bass line and strikers based on a Dresden document. Recently this was found by his assistant Muska Mangano. It's a masterpiece regardless the discussion.
+blooneyful soooo untrue
+master chief yes indeed
+master chief yes indeed
+xdeadstepx Samuel Barber, what a great composer
god bless that man to give us music !!!
omg this is my youth in one love it... bring bk ibiza

I picture Willem Dafoe kneeling down with a spongebob hat on holding 2 glowsticks.
ohhhh shit is this old i love it baby
Everything good about this song comes from Barber&#39;s original.
BRAVO GLIWICE 2000
Apparently Dennis Waakop Reijers claims that he produced this track, or at least co-produced. He was never really credited.<br><a href="https://news.beatport.com/dennis-waakop-reijers-tiestos-main-man-behind-the-boards-speaks-on-the-starsilent-partner-relationship/">https://news.beatport.com/dennis-waakop-reijers-tiestos-main-man-behind-the-boards-speaks-on-the-starsilent-partner-relationship/</a>

is the movie PLATOON REMIX
1,195 people are gammon, brus!
why does this song remind me of Kevin and Perry Go Large? Does this song feature in the film?
Hey everyone, I&#39;m just really getting into this type of music. Could anyone recommend some real awesome trance music like this? I&#39;d love to see what some lesser known artist are doing with this genre. Please and thank you everyone.
Superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr :-D
This went off at edc.
Yeah, didn't go to creamfields this year regret it, must do next year
+BootleScouser97 tell me about it! He usually finishes sets with it in the UK, same at Creamfields. Show stopper when live this one!
he made a masterpiece in my opinion,completely reversing the emotional tone of Samuel Barber&#39;s Adagio for Strings. i love both versions.
good!
me and my niggas praying for the current state of trance
perfeito♡ Amo😍
dont give a fuk i love this tune so troll all ya like cus i cudnt give a flyin fuk
Tiesto in Concert 2003 his best concert (great song selecting)
This repetitive hell shit makes hardly possible to recognise that there was one day a masterpiece behind this noise.
Tiesto used to make good music, but last 4years have been horrible, hope he would hear us and get his old thing back id travel a long way to come see him live again!
Always think of the film &quot;platoon&quot; when listening to this.<br>Excellent tune!
Trance is coming back slowly 
Great
Ferry&#39;s Idea
help
RIP
@Ghost Irena he didn't survive.... trance is dead and so is he:(
What?
es verga tiesto
I love thats trans 
Top favorite song by Tiesto. Haven&#39;t heard this song for about a year though. Glad I found it again!
@Christopher Ryals Top favorite really? Man even when Urban Train is a Tiesto song? LOL did you start to listen to tiesto in 2004? hahahaha, just kidding is all subjective but Tiesto made so many great songs before this one.
Wow.
ive listened all kind of remixes of barbers adagio for strings  but nothing beats this one even if its like almost 10 years old
@natalie shinobi Of course, the Ferry Corsten & Minimalistix remix do
Best best best song perfect
Kids, this is real Trance and the time Tiesto made awesome tunes. You&#39;d think he&#39;d gone deaf with the new shit.
@- - He was already slowly dying here, best tiesto era was 1998 up to 2003.
ABSOLUTE
INFITITY GREAT FEELING WITH THIS SONG
This trance is a drug for me, I get lifted
alexander de la cruz exactly mate.
>_> Hhahaa not sure whether to say the same or to say tf? lol
+alexander de la cruz barbara tucker also said the same thing, she even sang about it
+alexander de la cruz Scientific studies have shown it literally gets you high by releasing dopamine in your brain.
+alexander de la cruz feeling so gifted baby howd u get so fly
+alexander de la cruz Same dude
+alexander de la cruz Same dude
it&#39;s good but the version played on strings really moves me to tears amazing however this is the reverse on emotionally  powerful  uplifting  or was that&#39;s  the Age of Love  ? where we go now?
The memories.... how I miss my younger days!!!
amazing song
This sounds like shit... adagio for strings the orginal one was a great body of work.
Let me correct you! Tiesto WAS amazing, :(
Spirtual tune....quality!
that was the time xD. One of the best dance tracks of all times :P I can&#39;t even count how many times I&#39;ve played this sound when I was a kid xD
i love this song...after this i go to &quot;kai tracid&quot;...
Kopunn..
Kinda sad that the actual Adagio For Strings is the second search result instead of this one...
I mean, I'm not the kind of guy to say classical music is better just because of what it is. I've played all sorts of genres in my life, from Baroque to Power Metal and everything in-between, but the original Adagio for Strings is a special thing, man. You can't just mess with it and expect the version you made on your computer to be better.
+astropapi1 Agreed. I saw a comment saying that tiestos version was better, and had a better tune.... he wasn't trolling....

Benny Banasie
i love this song tiesto is best!
I love this song and I listened to this version first, but after taking time to hear the original it&#39;s kind of saddening that not many people have taken the time to hear the original given this has twice the views.
This was the best song that he did when He used to make trance....
Don&#39;t you dare listen to this until you&#39;ve heard the original Samuel Barber&#39;s Adagio for Strings. I&#39;m still wiping away the tears.
This never ceases to sound truly and utter haunting in the very best sense of the words. Magic. The sad part is being resigned to the fact that this era of trance will probably never be seen/heard from again. Fond memories indeed.
Dış mimar sağolsun güzel ritm :)
This is a trance version of a masterpiece orchestrated by the Czech Philharmonic. 
My Love Music by Tiesto, i prefer the original, LOVE LOVE Thank You Dj TIESTO, i love u soo much
REAL TBT GREATTTTTTTTT
Who doesn&#39;t like, that just a fool
@Torik 79 Or maybe, just maybe, they simply have different musical tastes. Kinda mind-blowing, I know.
Day: 16972 and my head is still bobbing to this. I need water and sleep pls like
if only all of these unauthorised youtube uploads of Tiesto&#39;s Adagio for Strings got removed...The original video on Tiesto&#39;s chanell would then have not 23, but 100 million wiews...but nope
ye omg what a melody from samuel barber :P
Immortal song!
j&#39;adore c&#39;est le meilleur dj que je connais vive tiesto
Reminds me of Kevin and Perry Go Large!! <br><br><br>Ugh I feel old!

Najlepsze!!!!
What song is this?
10years and still banging
When Tiesto still did Music... nowadays.. its just every song gets mixed by multiple remixes and sound the same.
Это стало классикой.
It would be better if Tiesto would have been turned into hardstyle than into that EDM bullshit and totally left trance...
After this song, automaticaly loads up Dj Tiesto - Live ultra music festival 2014... WE DON&quot;T NEED HIS NEW SHIT! Trance is all we need...
Marito baracusssss
THIS IS PROOF OF WHO THE BEST IS SHITS LIKE CLASICAL LEVEL EPIC
Just because someone likes electric, doesn&#39;t mean that one is not educated about classical.
VELHOS TEMPOS...
Szkoda ze Tiesto  już tak nie gra...
i always wished if Tiesto would add more beats to this music in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=2m41s">2:41</a> lol
Shame on you
Evil activities - adagio for strings 👌
amazing classic! not produced by tiesto though, his ghost producer made this, Dennis Waakop Reijers.
awesome!
The good old Tiesto... what a track... REAL TRANCE
His music still makes my skin crawl in the genius music
Damn... I want to go 3-4 years back when I was 18-19 and dance again, dance like crazy idiot, dance till I can&#39;t stand on my legs anymore. I used to split from my friend in the club and dance for like 3 hours non-stop, all alone. I really miss those times, can&#39;t do it nowdays... it&#39;s just not the same drive and passion as before.
Tiesto.!!!&#39;💀💀💀💀💀😎💀😎😎🎶😎😎💀🎶😎🎶🎼😎🎼💀🎶🎼.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

so old but still so good
He was a God back in my days. I still listen him when I&#39;m not able to pick anything from shity stuff.
This was from 2003, still listening in 2015! Love it
Reminds of Approaching Nirvana&#39;s Beer (Extended Mix) in some points
tiesto uuuuuus  adagio for strings
esta musica de tiesto es lomejor...♥
Tiesto will always be an original trance classic creator in my opinion, and others...his vocal remixes inspired much of what I write now (most of y&#39;all don&#39;t know what those tracks are, that is how I want it :-) ...) These first artists of certain styles might not be my favorites but they shouldn&#39;t be shoved aside with generic mass produced soulless crap fake DJs etc. Sure a lot of artists go very commercial - they need $, who doesn&#39;t... But the first creators who paved the way for others should be given credit where credit is due.
old Tiestio is so much better than the new..
Drugs make these songs good
Samuel Barber - Adagio for Strings
muzyka z filmu &quot;Pluton&quot;
I love how old becomes new again no matter what. This melody is taken directly from Samuel Barber&#39;s &quot;Angus Dei&quot;. Awesome!!!
@J Kc The melody is a cover of a classical song and has been sampled many times over.
ohh&quot;...babyy......miz like sevenged folf under fools.........................
Deveria ser proibido a utilização de uma música maravilhosa como essa por esses djs idiotas que confundem barulho com música.

The best song on the summer 2005 yr Durowskie lake in Wągrowiec (POLAND)
I hope people know that there is an original &#39;adagio for strings&#39; which is a masterpiece.
idk if he made the song called "ayla" but if he did then kudos cuz that song is fantastic
+EJM3 TIL, thanks mate ;)
+komeetta666 Albinoni? LOL
+swagiejones 325 Look how many people are enjoying this track, everyone partying and having a good time, when ye see this tune played by orchestra, the people in tuxedos and black frocks look miserable ha ha
@Nikolas Petrou soz geez nearly all the decent tunes for the last seventy five years are organised by the world directorship of music
@EJM3 Platoon movie anthem
@Darrin Upjohn haha comment
@*****  go away
@EJM3 Yeah, yeah...we know. jeez....
@EJM3 And I hope people know this longer version is a masterpiece as well!
@EJM3 There is also a version older than this one made by William Orbit. I cant say I disslike Tiestos version but Orbit did it better.
@EJM3 its Mark sixmans song yes ?
@EJM3 Oh yes. Mr. Albinoni was a genius. This remix makes justice for the original if only one fan stops dancing even for a second to listen to the "original". <3
@EJM3 yep i i always thought how the f*** tiesto could make such a good song like this because every song he produces now is literly shit and than i found "samuel barber adagio for strings" and it explains everything :D
the old school of tiesto. now is shit. please comback!
An All-time classic, love this song so much...<br>As well as Elements of life.

Didem bebegim gel beraber olsun
Whyyy did tiesto have to sell out and start making house music? HE WAS BORN TO MAKE TRANCE <br>p.s. this song is amazing
I have to disagree. They are both great pieces of music. If it wasn&#39;t for the masterpiece, Tiesto would not have this song in his collection. And this is probably one of his best mixes. I mean, he is a DJ, not that it takes a lot of talent to be a DJ. He just happened to turn a masterpiece into a dance song. Can&#39;t brag about that too much, but still a good song 
back in 2008
Que te paso tiesto antes eras chevere

LEGEND
Try listening to the original masterpiece first,the song was meant to be emotional and sad.
I don't know about you, but I still hear the melancholy of the original in this version. This is really not a happy tune, it's dark and sad and I love it. Maybe not as much as the original, but this is still majestic.
Yes, you're right- the original was solemn and tragic beyond words. In my opinion? So much better. But then again, I'm not much of a dance/ electro/ trance fan (although trance I listen to more often), so although it's easy to be pretentious/snobby when it comes to modern day "Nicki Minaj" style 'music', I suppose it has it's place still, and this remix is just different- no less great.
the original piece.. its incredible!!<br>This is a great remix
People have to understand that both versions of &#39;Adagio&#39; invoke different emotions. Yet they are both remarkable pieces of music. Samuel Barber&#39;s version is obviously very solemn, and brings about emotions to the effect of a horrible injustice that has just occurred.<br><br>Tiesto&#39;s version on the other hand makes my heart want to jump out of my chest and explode in kaleidoscopic fashion. One melody - two very different songs. Both have their place.
This song has energy but I like the William Orbit version better...
It was Samuel Barber
@moses4188 Wait this was a remix of an orchestra piece...........Who actually wrote this song? Was it Bach or Beethoven? I forget who wrote the original but this is a remix of an 18th century piece of music LOL or the song could be older then that
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND HE WENT BIGROOM
omg il never stand still
Tiesto the best ever! my #1
Only if tiesto still made songs like this!!!
Love this track soooooo much
The Song that makes me love him 6 years ago , always epic
This is the seminal track along with Ferry Corsten &quot;Beautiful&quot;
Fecking beautiful
time to cry
PODWÓJNE DOŻYWOCIE ZA TAKĄ ZBRODNIĘ NA MUZYCE I TEN CHUJOWY REMIKS!!!!!
he played this at ultra yesterday it was dope
showww dw bolaa
Ultra 2015!!!! Was so great!
I am here because of ULTRA LIVE 2015 
@Alex C. M. if you only came to the original video Tiesto uploaded...
Me Too!!!
Fantastic stellar profile pic.! Alex
ehhhh
Same, it was fucking amazing...
Also here kas of UMF 2015
@starkyyyyy .I.
@JOSE ROVER k lol
@starkyyyyy  te mereces un like (y)
@JOSE ROVER okay
@JOSE ROVER Dude he did played that song near the end :) 
@JOSE ROVER Even with google translate I cant tell what you are saying, sorry I dont speak Spanish
@starkyyyyy  cual ultra  dicen si tiesto ni toco esta cancion en el ultra u.u
@***** clearly hahahaha
@starkyyyyy haha I take no prisoners mate :p
@***** calm down lol
Why are you even replying to my comment? 
ok,now u can go away tard
A whole new era after that. Great memories from awesome years. 
Tiësto is the grand master of all the dj&#39;s 
2015
Tiesto before he caught the uninspiring characterless club music bug.
+beatsnextdoor or, it could yield a huge fkn living,look at ALL YT comments - Unfortunately, it'll have to wait for tides in music to turn, or be like a reunion of sound tour lol
+Rob Prod it's not tiesto's fault that people are idiots.he has to make a living.doing trance in 2015 is not gonna help him do that.
@beatsByZlaya i agree ... but the old shit had me going for daiz DAIZ !
@Rob Prod Good thing these older songs are still available for those who like them, and he is making new songs that new people like. So everyone wins.
@Rob Prod got so mad when the crowd didn't react at all to Silence at last year's EDC. Barely got a reaction from this track also
He played on ultra 2015 and i was like wow
@Meno Very true, his recent music invokes no emotion. I wish he would make pieces like this one, If he played something like this at a concert people would go even wilder than with his new stuff.
Looking at his stuff now, I can't believe he once used to make listenable music.
@Rob Prod secrets?
@Reck Ü TOTALLY AGREE !
@Gryerdeili very true 
@sopelo666 all I can say is that he's done well for where he is and he deserves it. But I do agree that he does it for money but that doesn't change the fact that he's done so much already? I think he deserves what he gets handed out because he's been running this for a long time now and I think it's amazing how far he's gotten since 2003.
@Rəgan Shane Tiesto now is playing for children from USA whose have a lot of money and they pay well for tikets on Tiesto concert's or Tietso CD's,also Tiesto play now for money, not for the sake of music. For example Paul van Dyk or ATb are the same legends as Tiesto and they still playing trance, not big room house or trap. Tiesto is commercial now, other DJ's no.
Music changes from generation to generation, not everything can stay the same. Tiësto is still amazing and always will be.
Agnus dei??? O.O
Estuvo increíble en EDC México Tiësto!
Now all Tiesto does is remix shitty top 40 songs.
Hows Teisto 3 Empty Tables in pic Carl Cox would have all 3 + 2 CDJ&#39;s going
Tiesto Forever
Man this old school song from tiesto is bad ass even tho is from a while back ...but you know that sometimes old school is better!!😉😉😎😎
Tiesto he&#39;s one best dj off world
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=4m21s">4:21</a> still - after so so so many years - gives me chills.
not his best material but its still decent
this song like a space mega galaxy stars dance
Tiesto is Tiesto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
William órbit, best versión, tiesto sucks
released in 2005
@BasedLad AND STILL THE BEST
Overrated.
damn, this takes me back to more carefree days!
Takk
El mejor DJ del mundo,,,,, obvio Dj Tiesto
But where&#39;s the strings?
Awesome can&#39;t wait to dance n fly
OH my god what a melody <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>you get a medal if you get the reference 
+RASF74 Thats also the reason why this doesnt work as a dance track for me, only as a trance track. If you have seen the movie, you know what i mean. Its one of THE anti war movies.-.-
@RASF74 yeah you are right 👍👍✌✌👌
@RASF74 thanks man good movie too and this is a good song👍👍✌👌
Always think of the movie "platoon" when hearing this. Brilliant!
@Anastasia Radko ok gracias my son is 3 years old and love that film i think the name is BALTON I AM NO SURE THANKS ANYWAY GOOD DAY ✌✌👍
@Jose Isabel Lopez Avila no, unfortunately.
@Anastasia Radko this music was on one movie o video abaout snow dogs you know the name of the movie?my son love the movie!!!😀😄😄
@tabriz anetaporta totally sure, I'm a musician, i played both adagios - by Albinoni and by Barber and know this music very well. Samuel Barber - Adagio for strings. You can find it on youtube.
@Anastasia Radko u sure?
@tabriz anetaporta no, it's not Albinoni, it's Barber.
Don't believe you guys, it's probably something else.
@ᅚᅚᅚᅚTomaso Albinoni  - Adagio for Strings (18th century)
@ᅚᅚᅚᅚ olver hooldons - melody
Can someone please tell me the name of that song?
@TeraFlopMC Then I'm only partly right. Because technically, the very melody is from Samuel Barber's Agnus Dei. (also known as ... Adagio for Strings). The one we hear in Oliver Stone's "Platoon".
@Jugurtha Hadjar No. When he wrote OH in capitals he ment Oliver Heldens, a deep house producer which made a song called Melody.
@Can't Think of a name "Agnus Dei", which means "The Lamb of God". Hence, your reference.
@Can't Think of a name What's the name of that song again?
@Can't Think of a name Oliver Heldens - Melody?
@Can't Think of a name clubbed to death..
he brought out his track melody which heavily samples this
@Can't Think of a name but hoolduns didnt remix it
😂😂😂
perfect...
good songs ** dj tiesto an incredible artist <b>*******</b> jajjajaajjaja and adagio for strings blasterjaxx remix
I love peaking to this

every time I listen to this I just want to shout HOLLAND!! MAKE SOME NOISEEEEEE!!! 
You guys should listen to the actual samuel barber adagio for strings. Very pretty<br>
Na al die jaren van zoeken. Heb ik eindelijk het nummer gevonden waarop ik geen idee had wat de naam was! Merci beaucoup Tiesto! Nu worden de fuifjes in Versailles uitermate top!
Masterpiece of Trance!
The first lead me to trance is via Tiesto
Tiesto never produced shit in his career ,he just knows what kind of shit to buy and how to promote it.
if you liked this song you&#39;ll like Oliver Heldens-&quot;Melody&quot; OMG!! I love it when they put classic music to a whole new level! THE BASS AHHHH!!!!
@Cailum Davis Let me add a little to that list: Audien - Hindsight (original mix) Audien - wayfarer (original mix) deadmau5 - The Veldt (feat. chris james) deadmau5 - Hr 8938 cephei (original mix)  Arty - Twilight Tonight (Arty Remode) Alpha 9 - Bliss (original mix) EDU - Action Hero (progressive mix) Mat Zo - Synapse Dynamics (Arty remix) Matt lange - sixty six  kaskade - 4am (adam k & soha remix) Estiva - I Feel Fine (Piano Mix) MitiS - Life Of Sin Pt.1 (Original Mix) Dinka - Constant Sorrow (Original Mix)

@Dan Gongora
@Rain Salazar Sorry but i disagree, Oliver Heldens didn't put classic on it's just three piano chords with some music (too much repetitive for my own). Tiesto use a more technical music who is "adagio for strings" from Samuel Barber.
@TheNytdj lol cannot disagree
@Rain Salazar No one cares, everybody raves to skrillex now obviously.
@TheNytdj That joke is old.
@Rain Salazar u make my day
tiene TODAAA la razon, precisamente antes de escuchar esta cancion yo estaba escuchando melody de oliver hendles
This song was produced long before tiesto was born.. He just added kicks, sidechained bass & synth
@***** i'm into progressive house..i'm into anything really.
@Rain Salazar Well im mainly a progressive and trance kind of guy, and house(sometimes when its not cheap commercial big room bull crap), what do you like?
@***** that's all good. do you have any recommendations? 
@Rain Salazar Melody is cool but its hardly a master piece, hey its just my opinion you know, just aint my cup of tea.
im not comparing, i still think tiesto is badass. im just saying i like these wonderful master pieces.
Omg thank you
@Sam Bou Karam Shut up bitch
@Rain Salazar Thanks for mentioning Heldens.As you said, I liked it. :)
If you liked tomatoes im sure youll like cat meat as well. same thing, i just said the same thing.
@Sam Bou Karam you're right bro!!😉😎😎
I'm musically retarded so could someone please shed some light on the whole "melody sounds a lot like/is plaigirising adagio for strings" thing? I know they're both very melodic but that's about it. 
Hey, Melody is brilliant in my opinion, despite Heldens being very hit & miss for me I fell in love with Melody, but I can't deny it has nothing on this, which I believe is one of those genre-defining tracks. If anyone asks me what sorta Trance I listen to this is the first song in my mind, everytime. But hey, Heldens is creating a pathway for people with more 'modern' tastes, just like Vicetone did with Tony Igy's masterpiece that is Astronomia.
This is better with some LSD, oh yeah!!!!!!!!
@Rain Salazar Melody is trash compared to this masterpiece... 10+ years later this song stills gives you goosebumps...
Nope. Melody is a piece of shit... And guess what my favorite genre is Future House. MINDBLOWN ? Quality > Quantity
So true
sawwattoommmmm xxxxxxxxx
Platoon brought this song to are ears and thank you for that :)
This track is like a .svg image. No matter how loud you play it the quality remains.
:3 
Tiesto+Dj Splash+Tony Igy+DeadMau5 = way of life
None of the power of the original. 
@beatsByZlaya Listen to some depressing Electro. Tell me what you think.
@beatsByZlaya Psychological issues? Because a song can make me teary? I don't see how those two connect. The original song can help express depressing themes. Have you listened to Adagio for Strings?
@Brian Moffatt You have serious psychological issues my friend. Please go to a doctor so he may help you.
@AJ Miller Definitely not. If put to a depressing theatrical scene, the original song, Adagio for Strings, could make a grown man cry. This is remix is Trance. I've gotten teary at good Electro and Glitch Hop songs, but not Trance. Too jumpy for that.
No shit, mate.
Armin van Buuren: Serenity ist besser als das, es hört sich auch ähnlich an ist aber besser ;)
TRANCE IS NOT DEAD
2018 yet sure is not dead ;)
+Alex Shi Trance as we knew is gone, probably forever.Still , check Aly & Fila / Bryan Kearney / Jordan Suckley / Sean Tyas , just few of the top
@Paul Bolton no 2009
Absolutely trance will never die in my eyes I miss those days where every Friday and Saturday there was just a mix full of trance and dance from the club on the radio even in the US I used to take cassette tapes back in the early 2000s and just record darude tiesto and shit like that it's the kind of music that just takes you to another place
@***** I don't know where you're from, but here in The Netherlands trance was very mainstream untill 2004 and even 'till 2008 it was very succesfull. What I mean with trance dying is that the sound Tiësto did for example replaced the original deep, hypnotic trance sound from the early 90s.
@Paul Bolton it didn't and if it ever died, it died in '96 or '99.
@Paul Bolton I Don't know about that,there is a psytrance rave party almost every weekend.And i've been going on festivals for the last 5 years,and they still go hard.Actually i don't think there is anything on the world that goes as hard...Have you been to ozora?boom?lost theory?tree of life?
@Paul Bolton I Don't know about that,there is a psytrance rave party almost every weekend.And i've been going on festivals for the last 5 years,and they still go hard.Actually i don't think there is anything on the world that goes as hard...Have you been to ozora?boom?lost theory?tree of life?
Nope. Just listen to anything on JOOF recordings. Shit takes you in a journey.
@Paul Bolton but PvD
Yes it is. It died in 2004.
This song always remind me of fighting 20 guys in the club
this is literally a disgusting mocking of a masterpiece by S.Barber, I can&#39;t believe there are people who can simply come and take a crap on an extraordinary work of genius and the worst is that there are millions who appreciate this act. 
@Vytautas Straižys You're disgusting.
@Vytautas Straižys your videos justify your comment.
@Vytautas Straižys Testiclio is my go-to example of how you can take all the merit out of electronica if you really commit yourself to mediocrity. whooo, ibiza.
@Vytautas Straižys What you just said is true up to some point, as the original versions (in most of the cases) stay unrivalled. The problem with you though is, that while pretending to be a great masterpiece expert, you are nothing more than a yapping bigot who has no appreciation for different approaches to music whatsoever, which makes you an ignorant music amateur enclosed within your one-track minded bubble.
@Vytautas Straižys I have listened to the original, and as someone who listens to copious amounts of classical music, it's this sort of elitism that is killing the genre. Step off the high horse and expand your boundaries.
@Vytautas Straižys Shut the fuck up you egoistic idiot.
@Vytautas Straižys lol, sorry but its true.
@***** :D :D :D :D LMAO
@Vytautas Straižys no tiesto turns a boring ass work of art into a much more exciting masterpiece....
You obviously can not appreciate music. The classical masterpiece is just that, a masterpiece. This rendition with techno music is quite different but none the less, an extraordinary mixture. My favorite music is death metal, but I can at least appreciate talent no matter what class of music it is. Either learn to appreciate all music, or keep your ignorant commenta to yourself. 
@Vytautas Straižys Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Both versions are pretty good. In my opinion, this version ruins the entire vibe of the original version by Samuel Barber. Nonetheless, it's a pretty good song even though the original is way better.
@Vytautas Straižys Actually, I adore both versions, they're both fantastic in their own ways 
why don't you take this song as a tribute to him? i bet tiesto thought the same.
I think this is the original m8
Actually, it's a matter of preference and yours happens to lean towards the original. We happen to prefer this, and I highly doubt that is about to change any time soon. I know mine isn't due to a long running hatred for most classical music. 
open your ears and hearts and listen to the original :) you can easily realize that the act is as wrong as puking on da Vinci's "Lady with an Ermine" and present the result as a personal, admirable work of art. 
FUCK OUT THE WAY!
Then go and appreciate your own music, and leave us to enjoy ours, please. ^^
Do you speak Remixes and Rearrangements son?
Little bit of hate huh
Because of this song, I love TRANCE forever...!
X
My rating 3+ of 5. Nothing special.
oh barber, what has this jerk done to your masterpiece?
false, now instead of sadness i cry because of frustration and hatred ;-) if you like it fine, more power to you, but i find it kinda offensive and insulting to the original. to each his own i guess.
Made it so much polished so that people actually enjoy it instead of crying :)
wtf ??? it&#39;s made by tiësto
HOUSE GOD &lt;3
@Jeanne Posthumus This is trance little girl
@Jeanne Posthumus house? Don't you mean bigroom house! Those are two different things
@***** totally, he was better back then
He should go back to trance!
Also, he has music in both trance and house. More recently, house.
@***** What matters is that I enjoy it ;/
@Nicolas La Rotta What matters is that I enjoy it 
Actually trance...
girl this is TRANCE
Yeah! So, where are you living right now?
No worries! So glad I was able find you so many years later. 
Hey!  Sorry i didnt notice this message!
Hello sister :) Bevapin ;)
Meh. Barber was a genius... This could have been so much better; instead he borrowed a hook and left all the genius behind.
Pobre Samuel Barber...
The memories that flood back with this, sitting like a Cheshire cat with smiles on my face and the kids wondering what dad is thinking about, if only they knew me before i was a dad lol. LOVE this its amazing.
gringos your sucks
la mejor de todas.
What a piece of shit. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s based on that masterpieced song. Tiesto should be awarded as a best shit maker ever. 
I remember when my friend told me, &quot;You know Tiesto did a version of Adagio for Strings?&quot; And I was like, &quot;wait... Tiesto?!&quot;<br>I&#39;m so happy she showed me.
Tiesto is biggest sell out ever in EDM. Sold all his trance fans for house music money. He used to be king of trance and he is only a follower, Dimitri, Like Mike, Hardwell and many others all shit on him. If not Tiesto&#39;s past history with trance he would not even make top 20 at DJ MAG. And his pathetic excuse for quitting Trance &quot;people are not interested in trance anymore&quot;, duuude while playing Trance you were easily best i the world DJ and right now as I said you would not make top 20, just thank your past which made you so famous
true
His facts were all true dude. Just that Tiesto is still dj who produces shits now
Trance&lt;3
The 1st song when I met Tiesto d*_*b
I love you Tiesto💜💜💜
In my top 3 favorite songs of all time..
tiestooooooo. yıne kafamı dağıtıyorsun.
Sevgili ! Sensizliğin en dibindeyken bile .. Baharları topluyorum avuçiçlerime.. Bize ait bir anda.. Bilindik bir anımızda .. Sevdamızın şarkısını söylüyorum sen diye diye.. Yokluğunun uçsuz bucaksız bitmeyen yollarında .. Sen bildiğim gölgemle.. Deli rüzgarlar eserken.. Durmaksızın yürüyorum.
Fuck yeah.... so many great memories when listenening to this.....
i miss this tiesto
Lovin&#39; it... 
What a tune! Enough said 
Holy shit. MEMORIES!
 If it wasn&quot;t for william orbit &amp; ferry corsten this piece of music would of never been, the remix was awesome, luv  old tiesto.   
I think most credit should go to Samuel Barber but yes I do love this !!!!!!!!!!! 
ibiza here i come 
now there, what tiesto has done is taken a 1940s song made by Samuel Barber and added a few drops to it and cashed in millions... cudos tiesto, very uncreative...
Then why don't you try it son? You think you can cash in millions?
@vicky vic And that's what's wrong with the world....people with your thought process. You never consider the origins...only the end. Yours is a wasted existence if all you see is what is immediately before you. 
@vicky vic Yeah, but people who actually still use their brains know that the original song (in this case) is much more better.
Nobody gives a shit.... People care only abt music... No matter about it's origin
Tiesto made it sound better :)
Barber's song is a masterpiece. Fits perfectly to the "Platoon" which is the masterpiece as well.  On the other hand, that one above our comment lines is a shitpiece.
Nice 
Tiesto has played homeworld...
Peeps, u ave ur opinions &amp; rightly so, but, i still like this tune, no matter what format it&#39;s done in......
I remember when tiesto was good. Too bad his newest album kinda sucks
Yeah that's a profile pic!
Boldog Születésnapot!! :) :) 
The drama, melody and beuty from the original and the energy of trance. Together they make one masterpiece. Very well done by Tiesto and of course, Samuel Barber.
And of course William Orbit.
When the Fallen Angels gets their wings back :D
Adagio for string is an old classic music that used to make ppl cry, so emotional it was. I am sorry for ppl who can&#39;t understand what electronic music really is. That&#39;s why I love tiesto! ♥ 
up! 2015 :)
Still as beautiful as the first time i heard it,<br>I remember sitting around the computer  with a bunch of my friends volume on max and just having this play on repeat over and over.  We all got goosebumps every time <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=4m22s">4:22</a> dropped. 
Tiesto remix from the original Adagio For Strings by Samuel Barber! And epic trance/EDM with touch of classical orchestra :)
This is the song that made trance so famous
amazing sound, the best dj !!!
Interlude
Reminds me of childhood,fucking love this song 
this is bad on so many levels oh god
Mine world! :o)
ooooooouuuuuuuuuaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiipppppppppp
Still popular. Tiesto the best!!! :)
Отличная музыка просто супер<br>
Have a good 2015 all<br>Happy new year
I really can&#39;t stand this type of music, but this always gives me chills every time I listen to it idk why 
@Laura Summers unlike everyone replying to you, i think it's because samuel barber's original melody is universally moving... even when a cock like tiesto butchers it in such a fashion
@İlter Turalı Trance is a wonderful spiritual vision of a future utopia. Heaven on this earth 🌍
@Laura Summers and we cant stand people who dont understand what Trance is
nothing wrong with raving
@Laura Summers Because it embellishes the souls of all those who overdosed on drugs while raving to it.
@Laura Summers Please listen to this, Eyal Iceman - Return To The Classix ENJOY
Right
@Laura Summers welcome to the trance world :)
Lel same i always thought this kinda music is techno and i srsly hate it when i was young but it juz give some out of this world feeling and sometimes give me bad memories for some reason
that's cause you secretly love trance
@Laura Summers Adagio for Strings op.11 - Samuel BarberThat's why
Maybe you like it too much so you have to reject it to maintain sanity?
@Laura Summers : TIESTO POWER..!!!! XD I still listen to this song... Amazing track.. Gives me Goosebumps everytime.. Enjoy.. :D
Same hahahaha
Gordon Brown&#39;s favourite piece of music. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d approve.
Did anyone else get goosebumps? holy cow the chills!
Love/Hate
but yes, tiesto, you are the best from Galicia, Spain
when i was 15teen very great. NOW, IS OTHER THING. Sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
when tiesto was a good DJ
He is still good in my opinion
@1010511 and it's god not gosh troll harder. 
@David Santos pff tiesto know nothing yet has very good touch in his music :)
her butt is fake
@***** oh my gosh look at her BUTT
@holypaladinpewpew fuck off that song has nothing to do with this song and anaconda is a horrible song
$128-
my anaconda dont want non HUN
I am agree with you guys. Tiesto leads me to the trance world before this.
i agree
When most music wasn't crap
DJ Tiesto ,,, Simply the BEST&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
stare dobre czasy
2019
Jeff&#39;s gettin&#39; some sloutz on that shit breh
this music should be in some epic moment in films
kevin and perry go large ?? :)
Its not the real one
it&#39;s such a shame that tiesto used to make such good music but now he&#39;s sold out and made EDM rubbish 
I remember dancing to this in Club Europa in Leeds in the late 90s ..... great dance tune!
Omg memories lol 
If it is mundane musics, i dont know what are heaven&#39;s musics ....?
Nooooooooo,how can touch and say so much in that song ?Awsome.
ONLY ONE WORD NEEDED TUNEEEEEEEEEEES
Way to fucking ruin the original.
@carlo alexander Except for the fact that some people find classical orchestra boring, and overly repetitive. Overly repetitive can be alright in some circumstances like in trance, but boring and overly-repetitive is a very bad combination. 
Just never listen to it again and go listen to classical orchestra and your life will be better
@Perfect Dark Well I'm generally into more positive or technical music. But some depressing music is decent. Only a handful I like, but adagio for strings by barber is not my pick. No where as good as this version to me. If you prefer it that's your opinion, but it's not mine.
@Magnus Imperium You make it sound like a musical piece that is depressing is a bad thing..
@Perfect Dark lol
EYY PEOPLE, WHAT ABOUT YOU SHUT UP ABOUT WHAT IS BETTER ? BOTH VERSIONS ARE GOOD IN THEIR OWN WAY S TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. just to be objective, i like both.
@Magnus Imperium The original is so much fun to listen to!
Lol the original is boring, and depressing. Screw that, this is like a transcendence out of life piece.
That's bullshit , this is a million times better
That`s right actually.
it's not your music
like this song
Kevin And Perry brang me here
Essa musica ficou legal
the best song :)
Albinoni Adagio in G minor  
love this close ur eyes n dance n drift off
Wow. Love this. Brings back memories from playing homeworld!
If you have a moment, take the time to look up the original version of this song by Samuel Barber. It is a beautiful piece
tej piosenki można słuchać w nieskończoność ! ma w sobie to &quot;COŚ&quot;.......
the best tiesto
wow I like his song so much this song is ancient. And everytime I listen to this song I get hypt up like shit this song is amazing . tiesto is the creator and the god of trance!!!! good times
Benim dünyam müzik ve tiesto and. Huzur😈😈😈
Thx TİESTO
AS IF HE DIDNT PLAY THIS LEGENDARY SONG LAST NIGHT !!! STEREOSONIC2014 &lt;33

Old but Gold &lt;3
this is good but ferry corsten remix is much better!! is my opinion.
omfg i remember watching a video about counter strike while this music on 8 years ago and i wanted this music so bad but none gave me a name of the music and now after 8 years i found it what a fucking coincidence, thats give you the meaning of  DO NOT GIVE UP :)
I remember the same thing, but i knew the song aswell tho haha!
@Johnny Brewo how did the song go?
You are confused KroOoz the track you were looking for is Darude- Sandstorm.
@***** maybe I can help you out my dear
can any of you guys help me tho,,, i have a song i recorded 5 seconds of it.. and i still can't identify it.. i will send it to your email if you don't mind.., plz help i am giving up :'( 
@***** This was fucking awesome to read! 
@MrVidsAllDay well what was the song? Maybe I would like if its that good.
Dude I've felt that same relief before, that constant itch you can't scratch when there's a song stuck in your head that you can't identify! I had a similar experience with a song I heard in a movie that was not in any OST, nor could anybody identify online. After endlessly and relentlessly searching for the song and coming back to my search again and again after it proved fruitless, I finally found it almost 5 years later!! THE MORAL OF THIS STORY IS NEVER GIVE UP HOPE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS!!!!!! THE MUSIC IS OUT THERE YOU JUST hAVE TO FIND IT! WHOOOOHAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
@Johnny Brewo bro, don't give up, keep your ears open, i just realized the name of my song is "im blue"
You know, I'm pretty sure that Soundhound and Shazam were made sometime between then and now.
@Aaron MacDougall Platoon, such a good movie
@Håkon Dekkerhus Trance*
song in the movie Platoon with Charlie Sheen and Dafoe - good movie - Tom Berenger too

Samuel Barber wrote classic Adagio For Strings when lover broked his heart and Tiesto make an EPIC trance version of this eternal sonata
. This song runs through my veins .Only Tiesto can do this real
Love this almost as much as William Orbits version!!!....
wao  q  icreible
The original is better !
What means &quot; Adagio for Strings &quot; ?
txh for explanation mate
Adagio is a musical term in Italian, it means "slow". Many composers(mostly classical) tend to name their piece after their tempo(speed). The tempo of the original by Samuel Barber is Adagio, and for strings(violins, violas, cellos, double basses). So, "Adagio for Strings".
genius!!
hola! i enjoy ur mix! im all the way from Belize! 
platoon its good
Epic moment since <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIgN7eICn4&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a>

there are dj&#39;s and there is tiesto he is the greatest of all time
I used to be into house and trance when I was a kid but then I switched to rock and metal for more than 7 years now.<br>However, recently I came across this track and all I can say is still...Brilliant! This piece of art passed the test of time!!!
I grew up with this music
Tiesto needs to return to trance...thats the music that put him on the map...
This song gives me the chills...... epic just epic &lt;3
&lt;3 bravo 
&lt;3
Never gets old
i know this old. but i still like this trance of all in my life :* tiesto :*
I couldn&#39;t listen to this after hearing the original
extraño este tiesto
:&#39;(  Tiesto love &lt;3
Yes... The best song of tiesto 
Rip Old Tiesto
I Hope Tiesto will be number one<br> dj 2014
now,where is tiesto..he&#39;s dead ...
la mejor de lo mejor
i can only imagine what ppl felt when he dropped it live for the first time..
holy jesus :-O 
Like if you still here it at 2014 (Y)
this is so vampire BDSM kinda vibe, i feel old now.
I like ... tout simplement !! Like or don t like, a vous de voir !! ;)
(Y)
tried remaking this song, and there&#39;s so much complexity. layers upon layers upon layers, and tiny details everywhere.
when tiesto was still in trance...
Love it or hate it, it will be remembered by all of us as a trance classic. Criticisms and hatred are Peoples feeling and they are entitled to that. All though theyre wrong this is a great song.
Turn your sub woofers up, get that DAC going and Pump this up!! AWESOME TUNE

im sorry sir but ur son was rekt
Tiesto sigue siendo chevere solo que ya en este mundo existe más generos y no puede entrar en todos, para mi sigues siendo el mejor.....!!! sldos
TIESTO, ANTES ERAS CHEVERE :/ 
Rip tiesto
Sigue siendo lo mejor de sus inicios.... El genero ha evolucionado mucho!
This music gives me chills, just great music... too bad he switched to that new crap
now this is music
oto jedno z tych arcydzieł muzyki elektronicznej która w niewiarygodny sposób daje potężnego kopa i MOGĘ WIĘCEJ 
thumbs up if u knew of Tiësto before Samuel Barber
haha people
@Adam Field u're a real dork
@Sebbu Kabir Did I sound like one? I was just stating my opinion.
@Eric Y ? u a hater
@amionutube I weep for our future.
wait who is samuel barber? another dj?
@Adam Field Might be over thinking it
ur a cornball know-it-all
@boo stick I imagine you didn't get very good grades in high school English if you consider one small paragraph an "essay".
@Adam Field wow. you're lame. you wrote a whole essay.
@Adam Field no im dead cereal 
Thumbs way the frack down. Are you trolling? Not that DJ Tiesto is necessarily *bad*, but this arrangement is. Samuel Barber is one of the most hauntingly brilliant composers in the history of classical music, this is one of his best works, and this arrangement is frankly kinda terrible. Which is not to say that electronic rearrangements of classical works can't be good - K-Complex's arrangement of Adagio for Strings is somewhat better, though still not amazing. On the other hand, some of the tracks on the cd Mozart Master Mix are up there with the originals. O Fortuna is a classic for a reason, but I actually prefer the remix off that cd to the original, for instance. Not so much this one.
@rebecca dugdale who the fuck r u?
who the fucks samuel barber
I like you better with your OOOOOOLLLLLDDDDDD SSSTTTTTUUUFFFFFF!
I.love track
too bad tiesto left trance and went to progresive house....
Platoon Movie Sounds!
this has stood the test of time... ;)
I used to love this ten years ago and I probably still do. And probably will never forgot this :) It&#39;s just too epic.
amazing, d-.-b
140mph down M1 to this ghee
Ferry Corsten&#39;s remix is infinitely top. And Ferry was first :)
who do i always think of willem dafoes flailing hands during this track??

Mąż uwielbia ten utwór.Dla niego to życie i śmierć,radość i gniew,płacz i śmiech.   KIEDY ZNALAZŁEM SIĘ NA DNIE USŁYSZAŁEM PUKANIE OD SPODU.
I&#39;ve been listening to this for weeks back in those days. It brings so many memories for the past - at the same time nostalgic and happy for remembering.
MY BODY IS READY
Great track, brings out the best memories for lots of people. If you don&#39;t like it, listen to something else......simple really.
Top choon that!
This song always makes me wanna go to sleep, what a tune. We want the old tiesto back
krut!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
a naleśniki jak sie robi ?
just .... &lt;3 
temazo.
this is the tiesto i grew up with...
replay replay replay
Lo maximo Tiestooo, me encanta esta cancion :)
Much better than Samuel Barber.
I am enrolling in dubspot in the fall, and I will gladly do a remix of Adagio for Strings. One of the most powerful songs ever...
(y)
No kurwa klasyk
will always love William orbits version (and the ferry korsten remix), but the build up to this is crazy, it takes like the whole song to get into it. The synths are well pick out...
dem memories
is this dub step?
The good old tiesto...
vamossssssssss!!
Most overrated track of all times?
@James Martindale Obvious troll is troll lmao.
@James Martindale shit annoying song 
@James Martindale WTF? 
stupidest troll comment ever more like it :)
@Isaac Shekelmeyersteinbergkhanskiwitz I agree with you partly.
Tiesto was always commercial cheese, even when he was supposedly a "trance god". Just check what other trance artists have been producing at the time he was most popular. He didn't even come up with the idea of remixing the classical piece in trance style. He just edited the already remixed Adagio for strings. Tiesto is pathetic
@Jesse T Ok I listen the old TRANCE which is the greatest music on the planet (in my opinion) TRANCE FOREVERR!
@Dac DT s Most trance is shit nowadays. But I like uplifting trance a lot. It still has that trancy feeling in it.
Maybe it's old but it sounds GREAT. The "new" trance sound like every house bullshit of the 2010s. TRANCE WAS THE BEST IN THE 90S AND THE 2000S TILL 2006. TRANCE FOREVERR!
@***** Sure, let's go!
@Jesse T  You might dislike this song, but you are one smart person - i would gladly smoke a joint with you, or drink a beer what ever you like more.
@***** Why would I get angry? It's completely normal for humans to dislike certain things. You would have to be a real crybaby to feel bad about that. In fact, if you feel bad about someones opinion, you should just fucking quit. That's how much of a loser you're then. There is not always reasons for disliking something.
@***** Arguments? This is barely even a debate. All you can say is "LETS SEE U D BETR", which has NOTHING to do with what we were originally talking about. So fuck off now you stupid kid.
@Jesse T  I think he realized how stupid he really is.
@Jesse T  Yeah, otherwise you are the denying the right of freedom of speech and then your a nazi (s33 h0w i fl11p3d dat around)
@*****​ It doesn't matter what I can do or can't do. I can call everything shit here if I want to. There's absolutely no reason for me to keep my opinions to myself.﻿
@***** Who? More experience on what? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, but that isn't relevant at all. If you are referring to musical experience, I'm going to facepalm the fuck out of myself.
@***** We want to comment and tell the artists to do better, cant we?
@***** Why not? Who the fuck decides whether or not you can criticize someone? It's not illegal, therefore you can do it.
@***** Why are you crying when someone is expressing their opinion? THIS IS WHAT COMMENTING IS ABOUT. It's about expressing your opinions, ok?
@Jesse T Yeah lmao, its not my fucking job to do better. fucking internet kids
@***** I know right. It's so fucking annoying. Almost as annoying as "LET'S SEE YOU DO BETTER".
@Jesse T  This keep to yourself argument is the most shittiest argument ive heard.
@***** Why not? Isn't that what the comment section stands for? That's like saying "Hey, if you like this song, don't tell it to us! Keep it to yourself!" Idiot.
@***** magic was and still is the original. this is not magic. This is trash.
@*****  can i be your friend?
@Julian Ramos What's the point of your comment? I did not only express my opinion, but debate why this song is not classic trance. Did you really not see that? How am I boring you? I wasn't even talking to you. I can probably still tell why I'm "boring you", you probably didn't even understand half of the things I said. Your grammar is awful. Also, DanusMinimus, what are you thumbing up comments there? Maybe you should stop ignoring my comments.
@Jesse T I have yet to see you state facts as to why this song is bad. Because all i see is opinions coming from you and your boring me. :/ I mean i understand when you say it's just not a good song in anyway. Very precise. But I'm assuming your a musician right? I'm assuming your an up and coming trance artist and such. Otherwise what your saying doesn't really hold up to the masses who think this song is great. Instead of trying to find a reason as to why this song is trash just enjoy it for what it is. Thanks, and best wishes to all.
@***** What do you base your facts on then? Your own fucking perspective? How are those facts?
@Jesse T Its genre is Techno-Trance, back when trance was shaping up, and your basing your stuff on google? good job.
@***** I did some research, and apparently a song called "The age of love" from 1990 is considered pure trance. This is nowhere near it.
@***** The artist I mentioned make uplifting trance purely. Does that make it classic trance, too? No. Just because this song has all the trance elements like any other trance song, does not mean it's pure and classic trance.
@Jesse T Its not for me.. its for everyone. its where there are only pure trance elements and nothing else involved, and all the artists you mentioned above blend more than trance elements into their songs.
@***** Also, this is not even that "classic". Trance was invented in the 90s. This song was made 2004.
@***** Didn't I already answer your question? It seems like the 90s and early 2000s trance is classic trance for you. Also, this is uplifting trance too. All those artists I mentioned make uplifting trance.
@Jesse T  Simon does make pure trance, but im talking about Classic trance - this is Classic trance, another example of classic trance is Elements of Life by Tiesto, this is the PUREST trance you could ever hear.
@***** Yes, I do. Ronny K, Illitheas, Eddie Sender, Andy Blueman, Simon O'Shine. All great artists.
@Jesse T Do you even like trance?
@***** It's not terrible only because of that. It's just not a good song in any way.
@Jesse T  just because its a remaster does it mean the song is terrible
@***** I don't listen to 90s or early 2000s trance, but this song isn't even an original composition.
@Jesse T what is your opinion of true trance then?
@***** True trance? Lol, give me a break.
This is one of the purest trance songs, it is considered a master piece to true trance fans.
@Miguel Pereira Ever heard about opinions?
@Jack Stewart I don't get it... What's up with this people and old songs? Today they are great, next week they are shit. " - Oh, Living on a Prayer is shit. - Why? - Just because it's old" Martin Garrix - Helicopter - 2014: Yeaaaay!! Best song ever!!!!! 2015: Oh, do you still listen to that shit? Just because a song is old doesn't mean it has lost it's value... Thats why in the old days artists went one for ages, now a talentless artist can make a shitty song that makes a lot of success, but they will only last for like 2 months or so. GO FUCK YOURSELVES ALL YOU PEOPLE   
@Alex_1210 Whether YouTube existed or not, is irrelevant. This song is barely average for the technology of 2003-2005.
@Jesse T Your point? 10 years ago youtube didn't even exist, music,- electronic music - was still made, but on (to us at least) "outdated" electronics. Look at how clear the sounds are in music made now vs then. 10 years is a long time.
@Alex_1210 No it's not. Look at the fucking date, it's 2014. Electronic music has been around for 6 decades.
@***** That has no connection. Don't be an idiot. 10 years is a shitload of time for music.
@Jack Stewart so to you 10 year olds are old as shit?
10 years ago!
@Jack Stewart 2004 is old as shit?
its old as shit what do you expect...
Totally...
I know right. Poor sound design.
OMG WHAT A TUNE!!!
tenia 12 años cuando escuche esta maravillosa y hermosa pieza y me di cuenta que me encantaba la música electrónica me pregunte de quien era y una amiga de la misma edad me presto un dvd de un concierto de un DJ y su nombre era TIESTO.......
Me paso lo mismo... Gracias a esta cancion me di cuenta q me gustaba la electeonica
Es la Historia Mas Obvia que e conocido
Que gran historia c:
wow :D 👏🏻
perfect ;) :D
El mejor clásico de Tiësto... 
I think elements of life is easily his best album
this is when tiesto&#39;s music made perfectional sence!
Sen Bu İşin Pir&#39;isin... I Love Electro I Love Tiesto...

GOOSEBUMPS OH MY!!
What happened to this Tiesto?

Dance with the original bitch.

7/6 live sofia airport!!!!! cant wait morons!
ningun remix de esta gran cancion la va poder superar esto es un clasico una gran explosion de verdadero trance :&#39;)
Tiesto will be remembered for this one..
David Lopez
Actually this will fade into the obscurity that most of this music goes to while the original remains a classic. There is literally nothing as far as I can tell that sets this apart from anything else. It seems like if you add a thumping bass to any song then people flock to it. 
@DarkDanjamin Yeah, I thought the same thing. I'm not going to go downing this in the comments because it's fine if some people like it, but it seems a little wrong to say it'll be him who's remembered for it.
good comment david
@Matthew Coleman Let us not forget William Orbit for first approaching the whole trance remake of adagio. 
They both will be, Tiesto for this mix which was the last played song in the 2004 olympic opening ceremony. and Samuel Barber for the eclectic and euphoric feel in the first place, leading to its extensive play in films and pop culture (through remix's).
Fair enough. At least you aren't one of the ones who thinks Testo made the song...
@DarkDanjamin I say both
no... samuel barber will be.
I think this is the best human creation ever &lt;3 !!!
excelente!
i remember as a kid when my dad listened to this and i was like what is this aria made by angels

BEST OF ALL TIME
An entire concerto, for an string orchestra, reduced to a single, staccato note pattern with hammering the background. =v= I need to die soon before any more of this crap that passes for music is conceived and birthed into the world. I appreciate modernisation of classics - there a slew of fantastic musicians out there using modern instruments and reinventing the classics. But this is crap, pure and simple. I&#39;m so damn sad.
28, thanks, hun. I just have functioning ears. Yours are full of wax from all the base reverberations, on the other hand, so I don't blame you for not hearing clearing.
Typical old fashioned person...im guessing 50 years old or more
lol thats so idiotic! Steal a good melody from a real musician and then take a bass and a typical techno rhythm and make money with it! And the stupid &quot;fans&quot; they dont know anything about real music, thinks its a superstar! Laughable!

STILL LOVE THIS SONG ♥
i hope he plays it on saturday in mexico 
good but absolutely nothing compared to William orbit&#39;s version.
Ferry Corsten mix is fucking PURE MAGIC, Trance...moving souls since time began!
me gusta jeje 
This would be awesome if he had actually created the string melody instead of just adding a generic beat to a part of Samuel Barber&#39;s adagio. Shame.
; ))))
Tiesto forever!
Like a prayer, like a litany ..<br>yesterday, today, tomorrow, forever ...
Esse so é pra mim o maior dj de todo o mundo!

Still Playing In Every Event (ASOT 650)
This sucks compared to the original, by Samuel Barber.
this is the best dubstep song iv heard
dubstep - it's a joke ?
@GeonXP89 No no, this is the internet, it is quite understandable
Hahahaha such a good troll
dont feed the trolls, guys
lol that dude made me smile :p Dubstep hahahahahahahahahaha Love Trance & peace to you all :)
@LeCool not even trolling. sarcasm at its finest
@Angel Shred that troll was so obvious, looks like some people are new to the internet lmao
SMALL PLAYER !!
Oh no, not the Master Ruseman D:
Look at all this fools, they have been baited and hooked... By the master ruseman :^) 
@Blaž Urankar I'm not sure asking someone to kill themself just because they mistaken a music type is very wise.
LOL!!!!!
nigga this is trance :)
how in the hell is this dubstep
lorenzo&#39;s oil soundtrack 
He basically took a shit on Samuel Barber when he made this hideous version of his great masterpiece, &quot;Adagio for strings&quot;. He left out all of the musical details, and completely turned the beautiful, slow piece into a fast, simplistic dance tune. Fucking horrible. If you want to know what it should really sound like, listen to the original version by SAMUEL BARBER. ......ahh, why am i even trying...... it&#39;s ridiculous to expect that you electronic &quot;music&quot; lovers can appreciate real music. 
thanks man and no problem, you take care of yourself as well.
@Robert Mahaffey fair enough, i got you all wrong in terms of "what "  you are and i apologise. I do agree with the general line of this thread as i think  you already realise. Truth is text is hard to read as you know..but youtube for me is one of the places that brings out the most negative people...armchair warriors. I get so used to seeing it i forget there are actual human beings like yourself still out there. You are a minority lol and i like how you handled that. take it easy
I was just using that statement because this guy thought he was something special for some reason. He was acting like being a classical musician put him above everyone else from my perspective. It can be applied to everyone but I was just using it to remind him that his opinion was simply one of many.
@Robert Mahaffey  not if it makes me giggle :P
@Sven Shestakov Obviously you're an unknown pianist with no relevance if not a single person knows who you are, so lose the arrogance. You need to realize that you are a completely insignificant speck on the face of this Earth and there are millions of people that do enjoy this type of music. Music is sound waves and it has nothing to do with whether or not the sounds were created electronically or not.
@***** well said sir
I love samuel barbers version...and dont much care for this one....but music is about choice....so you...are a dick! just because it aint for you doesn't mean you have some kind of musical rightousness that others dont
@Alf BlackandRed who am i? a classical pianist. I know what real music is. Anything that involves electronic sampled beats, isn't real music.
Go listen to it then and dont waist your time listening to music you dont like, only an idiot wouldn't appreciate Samuel Barbers original, but this is not simplistic, who are you to say what real music is? 
violins should be bought into techno more like this what a great combination of music 
Old thread I know, but I love Opéra-Emmanuel Santarromana. Gives me an eargasm every time.

lindsey stirling as well
@mattty105 No worries man.
@1999PhantoM thanks mate much appreciated  
Intense, by Armin Van Buuren feat. Miri Ben Ari is to me, the best example of trance merged with violin.
a great song from a great artist turned into something for techno i still enjoy this version could not be made better in my opinion 
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/c-fred/earth-life">https://soundcloud.com/c-fred/earth-life</a> check this if you like this song
tiesto? wtf dislike :D
esta rre bueno este tema de dj tiesto adgio for strings me rre gusta
bellisima

Actually it is a classical music: Samuel Barber - Adagio for Strings
lol who said it was different looooool :D
has more views than Samuel Barber&#39;s original version o_O
and thats sad..
mt mt bom
Dubstep and electromusic after 2010 is bullshit, now this is real electro music what makes you fly with it. Not eating brain with bzrbzrbzrbzr waaa bzrzbzbrbz...
best song ever,thank you Tiesto!!
Legend !
I find it till now simply amazing
Platoon!
What a track!!<br>Gets my heart and soul pumping every time 
SUBLIME!! Tiesto! 
original song by Samuel Barber
and the original sounds nothing like this
Best track ever
volveremos a ver a este tiesto algun dia? lo dudo ... :(
muchos opinan igual que vos, a mi me pareció muy distinto lo que hace tiesto o hardwell que lo que hace Armin aunque si me parece que ha cambiado un poco su estilo 
de esos que nombraste solo aly & fila
Dash berlin, Armin, Aly & Fila eso es trance
@Lucas Farias @Elias Sakkal Toda la razon Lucas! .. Tiesto tenia la posta en el Trance, ahora en sus set no hay casi nada :( este es el verdadero Tiesto, el del trance. Nadie lo va a igualar!! 
@Elias Sakkal Siempre fue comercial, solo que antes lo que estaba de moda era el trance, ahora el electro pop que le llaman trance tambien pero no lo es.
Se volvio comercial y es algo que tenemos que admitirlo...
Argentina, Ultra 22 de febrero. 
Aca en Chile, en Road to Ultra 21 de febrero :D jaja
best cover ever
What&#39;s the name of the original one? 
Oh cheers :D 
you mean who made the original? Samuel Barber, he made the orchestra version in 1936 and the choral version (Agnus Dei) in 1967.
Puta que pariu !!! Esse idiota não sabe nem o que significa &quot;adagio&quot;.
Tiesto is God&#39;s a gift to humanity.
Tiesto? A to się kłuje czy w tabletach?
This song will always be my anthem... I&#39;ll be playing this in my retirement home when I&#39;m old!

TIESTO=EPIC MUSIC :3
tro coool!!! tiestooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
One of dance music&#39;s greatest =P 
TIESTO THE KING OF ELECTRO
yeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssssss ^^
U got to be kidding me. Tiesto sucks with electro only good with progressive. Armin does Trance not Electro. Learn the difference. All music is based on music from the past and mixing of genres which create new genres. If it was not for Classical music, Disco, Hip-hop, Reggae a lot of the genres in EDM would not exist today. 
I've just read through the entire thread that came after my previous comment, and I am proud to say that you guys suck.  You're just a bunch of ignoramuses.
@sToneystaySeedless "Adagio For Strings" is a Trance remix made by Tiesto when he was a Trance DJ... the tune is older than u, so no wonder u have no ideia wht ur talkin about...
@JD3K it doesn't really matter what you call it.  half the world calls the new electro dub stuff (brostep) dubstep ... I am referring to EDM  electronic dance music.    It's not really a big deal for someone to not know the exact genre, this is a hard type of music TOO classify, as there are so many things you could classify it by.  you sir, are a troll.  :)                                                       
@JD3K troll     
:/ lol really i don't care it is music
@mattty105 better u read my comment twice b4 u answer... i suppose u didnt get the point :S   But, hey i cannot expect more from a guy who calls techno to every EDM tune he has no ideia whats the genre...
@JD3K funny how u say we are all ignorant yet if i told you all music started from jazz blues ect you would call me insane 
no no no, armin may be king, But only TIESTO is the Legend Tiesto no1 4ever
@sToneystaySeedless u kids are so funny... the real electro-boogie is not even electronic music... how ignorant u kids can be?? prob ur talkin about electro-house which is a fusion between 2 genres...
@JD3K Lol,   Trance, House, electro house, dubstep, brostep... it's all electronic music... electro is short for electronic... sooo. i see no flaw...
@***** Lol, Funny how they all 4 are Dutchmen Like me DUTCH FTW!
Paul van dyk was before Tiesto and Armin ... Paul van dyk is the king
@***** Climb out his arse
I'd say they're kings of neighboring countries.  It's pretty much impossible to put one above the other, if you ask me.
@***** armin is king of VOCAL TRANCE & VOCAL ELECTRO
He had the Odessy (BELFAST) beggin 4 more
my lord
love.2014
The reason of my trance addiction &lt;3 
My favorite song ever !! I always enjoy listening to this song ❤️❤️😍😍😜😜😉👍👍☺️😁😁💎💎💎💎💎
Rei.
sooo good music omg :((
buenisimooo
Manchester, 22/12/13.  What a night!
Celestial este tema
This is Shite , Modern dj&#39;s don&#39;t have a clue about making real music.
Music that is art ,excites ,invigorates and is innovative and creative. Dj aren't musicans ,gangsta's aren't musicians and that why they should leave music making to people who know what they are at.
what defines "real" music?
this is oldschool dj style tiesto now a days is became a more modern dj
one of the best tracks ever in trance history ....
Yo, we&#39;re new at this, so come and check out our first track.Rate,comment,and subscribe if you like what you hear,and even if you don&#39;t :)<br>PARTY ON
ok !!!!
Tiesto.... The lord of sound well its just my opinion!!!!!
old tiesto - the trance god
too many repetitive 
Fantastic, wit 1000 watt the glasses move in my living
Dutch.....
the best
como suena este muchacho
Basically every version of adaggio is brilliant because the original is brilliant. Yes Corstens is better i think, but no one is better than the original. Why hate one vs the other. Its pointless. And i know Tiesto didnt use this sample to score but just bcause he loved the tune. Stay positive all.. Peace
Ferry Corsten´s remix is alot better while staying true to the original remix made by William Orbit.
lo maximo brother esta rola uhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhhhh
dear Lord, best track ever.
visita 3703200 omg!!!
Kawałek petarda !!! ;)
AGNUS DEI<br>ok

Tiesto is teh best

Tiesto eres ,la,esencia de la musica progressive El número uno.
@Lux Harris Hola ,por supuesto que esa no ,se que es Estilo de Música … Trance, Electrónica ,pero a mi me gustan todos sus estilos yo por lo menos lo interpreto así. Corrígeme si me confundo, soy un poco pez en estos temas ,a mi lo único que me hace es ,relajarme y pensar. Disfruto mucho con su música tiene mucho sentimiento. A mi me gusta ,bastante. Y a ti.? recomiéndame alguna.
me imagino no te refieres con "progressive" a este tema verdad ? 
Exquisite Masterpiece<br>
Mozart.;-)
I stand corrected:-D
@John Oliver Agnus dei,  Latin, Catholic, Gothic, Mass.

The best of Tiësto♥
I somehow like his &#39;In the dark (dirty south remix)&#39; better than this one.
well, i guess because its Progressive Trance... it progresses? O_o 
it&#39;s not a good intro..... it just keeps on building up for a minute then drops completely for no reason...

I&#39;m a classical music player,and i really love trance,and i absolutely LOVE this cover... ppl should wake up and stop comparing this music to classical music... because they cannot be compared to each other,they are made for completely different purpose
amazing remix of amazing song
hello.hi.gaiz.is.samouargli.dj007.love
Fantastique !!!!! xxx
I have nothing to say ... it&#39;s really amazing ! 
I didn&#39;t know such homosapiens existed.
Thanks guys for all the nice feedback, Internet discussions don&#39;t always have to be aggressive, if people are civilized they can reach an agreement sooner. I think most people are aggressive because they have a need to prove something to somebody or themselves, here they can be 2 meters tall and spit fire, no one knows them so they just slam and don&#39;t even try to talk. I think it&#39;s a lot more gratifying to have a nice discussion. We learn things from each other instead of offending everyone.
Lets have more civilized disagreements on the internet, and loose the trolls. Would be a lovely day!
This is actually what brought me to trance - my love for classical music and soundtracks combined with my recent discovery of Daft Punk and their house music. Still getting into trance and house, not knowing whether I&#39;ll love as much as my other favorite genres, but at the moment it seems electronic music definitely has a chance :) And thank you for your commentary, it&#39;s nice to see a civilised opinion on YouTube.
Infected mushroom
Don&#39;t listen to this while driving on the highway... you&#39;ll wind up going 120+mph without even realizing it! lol
Best Song by Tiësto
good hehe :) 
fuckin this one... 
Classic tune, legendary!
In my opinion, I think Adagio for Strings is much better than Adagio for Strings.
both versions are great. Adagio for strings best song ever ! 
Guys,you have to hear the remix made by Ferry Corsten. Look for it as &quot;William Orbit - Adagio For Strings (Ferry Corsten Mix)&quot;. It is another level ;)
Bottom line, he immortalized the tune made by the original composer. That&#39;s all that matters :)
Both versions are good 
Shut up.
We are now witnessing the evolution of internet users, one comment at a time.
BEST WORKOUT TUNE EVER ! PROPER ADRENILINE INJECTION THAT.
Anti Stress
Simplemente perfecta
See for once there are actually people with different opinions respecting each other and not bitching because one doesn&#39;t agree with the other. Why can&#39;t people always be like this? It&#39;s so much better and easier and it&#39;s not a complete waste of time. I agree with both of you and your opinions because you&#39;re both right. This is how YouTube should be, but no; people have to be stupid and self centered. I automatically respect both of you guys, I know that doesn&#39;t matter, but it does.
Ni c T-I-E-S-T-O 
Yes. Thats why i love trance. Modern Classic
yürü be tiesto
2:25
just got home from seeing tiesto perform for the first time.. he closed with this song :p
0:17
check out my vids \
So true, especially about the last part about a lot of trance songs based of classical. It&#39;s not even limited to trance songs. Most good music was copied and taken from previous work. That&#39;s how nearly everything great comes from: taking something old and making into something new. Take a look at Harry Potter: JK Rowling copied so much of Tolkein and Pratchet that I&#39;m surprised she didn&#39;t get done with plagiarism, yet that&#39;s one of the best selling books of all time. 
Cream fields 2013 :D
I refuse to believe this. Must be fake.
29/08/2013 !
LIKE! 
this leaves me hanging in midair...yeah!!!
I wish all disagreements were this civil ^^
fav part at 4:21
Today land !
I do wonder what you have been smoking , whatever it is i want some of it because i seen tiesto live on sunday and words cannot describe how amazing it was to say the least. Search &quot;Tiesto live at creamfields 2013&quot; every bit of his set was unreal but i especially raved to silence and adagio for strings. he may be past it but he still got more of an atmosphere than anybody who performed that evening
samuel barbers original is far better than this 
it is hard to find good people on youtube nowadays lol. Youtube is full of haters and trolls
That was the most civilized argument I have read on youtube, finally not a bunch of pricks saying stupid shit lol.
WTF!!!!! A civilized disagreement on the internet. Mind blown.... 
this is the most addictive music 
IN TRANCE WE TRUST ! ! ! 
trance based songs it says
5:18 is the best part

ÖRÖKKÉ Kedvenc!!! TiEsto Forever!!!! GoGoGooooooo 
I don&#39;t believe in &quot;one version over the other&quot; either. In this case I think both versions are great :)
There should be more people like us on the internet...
misto 
lol aww
I adore the original adagio, but this... this is a masterpiece!
You can easily get over 3500 usd per month simply by responding to easy online surveys at home. This site shows precisely how is.gd\y50J0W
Kevin &amp; Perry brought me here, and oh yes Greystokes ! oh ! and Samuel Barber !!!! I love all music !!! you should try it !!!
Don&#39;t bring me down with all your hocus pocus history. If u wanna take team Barber, go ahead. I&#39;m staying with team Tiesto.
I like both versions, but I do prefer the original. I love classical music. Tiesto didn&#39;t disrespect anybody. He gave credit to the original, the name of the song is the same. So he did a good electronic cover and everyone has its own favourite.
I highly disagree. have you listened to house music?
They play the original alot in older war movies like platoon from the 80&#39;s for dramatic effect, long before these came out. I also believe there was a club adaptation of it in the like early to mid 90&#39;s of it. Still doesnt mean tiesto&#39;s and ferry&#39;s versions are not epic, RIP Gouryella.
F U C K I S R A E L
tiesto thought samuel barber to play this song on a violin he made from a milk carton an imagery strings 
classical music is great, but it only becomes epic when you combine it with 136-142 bmp and the right kind of leads that send shivers down your spine :) 
you&#39;re trolling right?? i didnt realise tiesto had this prior to 1936 which was when samuel wrote it.. that must make tiesto a vampire or something because he should be over 70 years old and still looking about 30 something..
I&#39;m pretty sure Tiesto did it before this Samuel Barber guy.
Mas a versão do tiesto é bem melhor cara, a original não chega nem perto. 
Reminds me of the days when I used to listen to Electro/Techno/Trance.
Damn! Fucking great! Sitting in garden with this play quality!
You are right! Samuel Barber gave me the goosbumps and i don&#39;t even like classic music that much. But i have to give William Orbit and Tiesto credits for translating this old masterpiece into one that have over 138 bpm! Now, lets produce one that is qualified as Hardstyle :) 
Every version is special and heart wrenching... one of the most emotional tunes ever written
William Orbit - Barber&#39;s Adagio For Strings
do you mean the Samuel Barber version ?
Tiesto Is a True Legend, The original tune is Great but I happen to prefer this as its much more intense. The way it builds up to the main bit, and Its well put together :D. My favourite song to date! :D!!!
I&#39;ve listened to the original before I read your comment and I have to say I really prefer Tiesto&#39;s version. I think he selected the best part of the original to put in his. WIch one do YOU prefer ? The original I presume ? At least you,re not saying that Tiesto disrespected his work like an other guy.
Agreed. I actually found this tiesto version while searching for the original :D I have not yet decided which one I like better ;)
PLATOON ???
Dude you are right. But he is a genius for capturing what was already made and turning it into something amazing. which is a great trance song! who would of thought of adding bass lines and synths to and already great composition. 
I was just saying earlier today that &quot;I bet actually very big part of people don&#39;t realise it&#39;s not actual tiesto song, rather cover&quot;. it&#39;s not bad certainly. and also I was thinking about the same thing what you said. I used to listen a lot of classical music and I found that there must be some connection why I like trance today.
yesterday land :D
number one tiesto
@john smith- this is music right? And music&#39;s music, stfu and sit down.
ale chujnia przereklamowane 
I already knew this, and I do like some Classical music, not too much though, and Tiesto still is a genius imo because he takes great songs and puts an energy boost in them. I would respect him more if it was his own original work 100% but I know what it is, a remix and a great song
UEFA- MAFIA
MONO APOEL
RookieThe is right, this is possible the one song that defined trance.
Really mate?? you obv don&#39;t know what is original trace and you are listening it right now... this track is one of the first HUGE tracne tracks in history 
Perfect in your words Karan......i agreed.....
And thats exactly because the most of trance musics, its a mix of classicals, is so f....good!!!!!!
trance will always be golden
I agree and to be honest most trance and rock songs have their origins on orchestra and opera music. The notes most of the times are based on them and as much as I love trance music i really love classical music too it is really a beautiful experience and anyone listening to any genre of music must listen to it once to truly understand music
is this new?
azerbaycan
Tiesto doesn&#39;t make his own music. Stupid as shit
i love what he did with such a sad song 
True haha :)
Still the best tune I know so far!! Ever! 
Go to the sickest squad opera prima , 2min45 this is some reeeeal good shit you can bang on with exactly the same melody :) 
i just came my pants &gt;&lt;
best trance track of all times!!! &lt;3 
What&#39;s wrong with you Tiesto???????? Before you were cool...
Mui bna rola nomas kn eskucharla asta seme va el sueño yea
your a disgrace 
lol this isn&#39;t half bad. the new tiesto is garbage.
pff
Hey guys, I see everyone saying this is a masterpiece, and some say it&#39;s the song that got them into trance, and Tiesto is a genius, etc. I respect everyone&#39;s opinion but I want to clarify that this song is mostly based of a string orchestra arrangement with the same name &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; by Samuel Barber. If you got the time check it out, pay your respect to the original and who knows, you might get into classical music, because a lot of trance songs are based of classical songs!! Thanks
Gives me chills every time I listen to this
F U C K I M B R H U 3
This cover is just a disgrace to the original Adagio for Strings

If this digital version can lead the listeners to seek out the original version from which it was taken, Samuel Barber&#39;s Adagio for Strings (parts of which are used here), then more power to it.

q estas flayando, si t la queres dar de el rechet@, decilo y ya pero lo que estás diciendo es cualquiera, no se puede ser discriminador si ocupas un lugar peor en la sociedad. y esta bien que la gente demande lo que considera justo y trate de recibir un trato justo por parte de todas las personas. además no te permitís ver que decir que los blancos gustan de la musica electrónica o del rock y todos los negros del rap o la cumbia es parte de un estereotipo para seguir con la mentira.
there are better songs bro but this is a really good one. 
Wow ..? Lot of hating going on... The original composition is incredibly moving. Brings me to tears. Great american composer

Make sure you don&#39;t say &#39;oh yeah, i&#39;m going to skip your comment&#39; cus, that&#39;s just going to want me to skip your comment, cus like, why would I do anything else. How about you just like say, &#39;I&#39;ve got some really cool music that&#39;s like this, come check it out an&#39; be amazed!&#39;
you know, people will find you, even if you don&#39;t put these up, I wish you the best, and hope someday you will achieve the dream all of us small time producers want. Best of luck- House Paint
La simple insinuación de que un blanco o blanca debe estar orgulloso/a de su raza es más que suficiente para que se le despida, meta en prisión, ataque e insulte…según los antiblancos, de algún modo vivimos en una “sociedad racista supremacista blanca”. Estos son los dobles raseros de los antiblancos. &quot;&quot;Antirracista&quot;&quot; es una palabra en clave para antiblanco.

this piece of art is going on my ipod!

Tiësto Rules!!! All his Songs are amazing !!!! especially For ever today 
I think I fucking hate this nigga, how could he just take the song and fuck it up like he did, what the fuck, I swear, this is not a piece of music where you can just turn into a electronic song, like shit, this is so bad its almost disrespectful 
dont forget about the Ferry Corsten remix of the William Orbit original Trance mix 
Tiesto is the best DJ.
Armin van Buuren Paul Van Dyk Above and Beyond ATB Christopher Lawrence
I was just a teenager when I first heard this tune and I loved it so much. I thought it was perfect. I still think it is perfect even though it was first created by Samuel Barber. I think Tiesto added a nice touch to it for our new generation.
o|^_^|o
no the best this i will be here!! :P

When he dropped this tune live in Los angeles in 07, I almost came in my pants...
When Trance music was barely getting popular he was the first DJ/PRODUCER to fill stadiums back in 2000, this song and others like Elements of life,Traffic, lethal Industry etc... were his best productions/Remixes back in a days and I also like the original song but this one isn&#39;t bad at all either, He is an amazing Dj/Producer for us that know a bit and enjoy Trance/Electronic music...
Recordar la popularidad de un verdadero dj

It&#39;s hardly mutilation to cover a song in a different genre. It may be rough on the ears if you&#39;re not a fan of techno, trance, or dubstep. However if you enjoy those genres, then this is a decent homage. I do think the reveal at 1:30 is a bit too drawn out for the genre, but that&#39;s a personal asthetic thing. Also, before 1:30, it&#39;s easy to asume that this is just another dance club mix.
Hace Un Muy Bueno Ritmo E Tipo Éste 
There&#39;s homage and then there&#39;s mutilation. This is a mutilation of the beauty of one of the best works in all of musical history.

to be honest, if this exact track was released today it would get relatively little attention... the drum samples sound pretty dated, not to mention that trance isn&#39;t nearly as popular as it used to be. great track though
if this track was released today.....it would simply destroy all other tracks in it&#39;s wake
I&#39;ll bet Samuel Barber would love Tiesto&#39;s awesome version on his Adagio . :)

nice piece man - your ability to mix soft edges with such powerful punches is sick - but even more - you mesh your slides &amp; temp so smoothly - keep it up! 
This song is so fucking awesome !
I love techno and everything but I still like the original song way better. This just ain&#39;t doing it for me.
I claim this land for Zyzz!!! Pussy ass bitches!!!
Because in 2005 we hardly used youtube. Youtube started to live in that same year. Now that this AWESOME track is altered, it can never reach that amount of viewers ever! If Adagio for strings was released now with the popularity it had back then, Gangnam Style wouldn&#39;t have drawn so much attention. But that doesn&#39;t mean that Gangnam Style has more listeners than Adagio for Strings had. I would even put my hand in fire for that!
Tiesto forever!!! &lt;3
before dubstep era: 2004 bde
Gods remix
This guy definitely knows how to crank out a beat!
idk why this track wasn&#39;t listened to 1bi times like gangnam style... :/
you mean 16.5 Millions !! 
Thumbs up if you are listening to this in 2013!!! Tiesto x Barber is awesome!!!

Sandstorm is techno, this is trance.

This is an authentic proof that today&#39;s &#39;&#39;artist&#39;&#39; are unable to CREATE original pieces of art, as they mostly just REMIX others&#39; truth work. That&#39;s sad...

BEST 
Tiesto is the best black dj
Tiesto
Being ignorant is saying that he does beautiful melodyes in this where the melody came absolutly from the piece. Putting a spin is changing harmonyes and melodyes with the idea of generate and impact different that the original, not substracting it. The soul comes from the melody, if you take the melody out is basicly nothing. Is not like other generic dancing music, but s dancing music in dancing porpuse indeed (if not, would not be EDM at all). I see myself listen the piece, not ripping it out
A W E S O M E
A W S O M E
ez állat 
ez a zene
That doesn&#39;t step out the fact that it becomes a piece full of emotions into a one &quot;punchy&quot; song. Is taking out all that make the piece a beautiful piece and use a 4/4 kick with the modified melodic line and a few synth adds. The piece is not even in 4/4 and has a lot of musical adds that he uncarefully take off to make a dance track. That&#39;s exactly why I say he tear it appart. I make music because I love it. And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t modify other&#39;s pieces.
@DarkBetrayer75 I could agree more. Well put
Is making a piece with a lot of motivational purposes into a one and only purpose: dance. I like EDMs, but not when it involve ruin a piece like this. Artistic is your keyword, mine is money. Is not melodic, because the melody is substracted and converted to a rythmic thing (the only thing he does with the melody is glitchd it up). And hell no is harmonic, because the real background beautiful harmonies of the piece are completly left appart in the remix. 
@xkahddb yeah people just dont get it this video is the best! AND.. you can use this to get this song on your ipod ==&gt; bit.ly/XUxBfa?=fowqq
It&#39;s not about a genre hater. I like trance, I like dubstep, elctro and others. You are being contradicted by your own argument with &quot;i don&#39;t like the genre...&quot; and &quot;at least pick something like dubstep or...&quot; It&#39;s about taking a piece and tearing it appart by making dancy shit. Exactly like that. As a whole lot of kind of music listener and sound engineering student. 
Music is a very personal taste, one should not judge a remix of a certain piece of music. I really think that DJ Tiesto did a great electronic version of &quot;Adagio For Strings&quot;. DJ Tiesto is an amazing at what he does.
That&#39;s the best you can came up with?
my fucking god. He should be so fucking ashamed for this shit... C&#39;mon guys! if you don&#39;t have talent for compose your own thing or even do a good remix don&#39;t fucking ruin an amazingly beautiful classic piece. Fucking shitty punchy dancy shit.
It&#39;s beautiful.
me too 
S I Z Z Y ***

listen to the muses rapt_spiritual healing if u never heard it..the best trance song that ever made...listen to dj yahel too he will made tiesto a amateur school girl:)
i&#39;ve listened to this song since i was in 7th or 8th grade. i&#39;m 21 now, soon to be 22. this song strikes a chord in my heart that brings me right back to those wonderful days of first discovering trance. this song changed my life. i love tiesto. forever &lt;3
He&#39;s Human you stupid!
He &#39;s Indian! =P
Best version of this track period. And stop with your youtube fights here you little children, go somewhere else for that bs.
fuck off with with your nationalism and idea of music as an industry. people are people, music is music. your argument would be way more valid if holland didn&#39;t create dutch house...thanks for the head aches, i miss real trance....
holand rule his name is litijd vewelt he is the numberone in the world of the dj
ahahah the top comment LOL
Only in your wet dreams.. And learn how to spell industry.
Cago a composição de Samuel Barber.
EPIC
I BLAST THIS ALL DAY EVERY DAY.
Dutch people are the founders of this music so stfu germany
congrats... but we rules trance and house witch is this song idiot
I think that behind the respect he shows me is his fear, but you now what it said you can get the real respect only with fear:)))
His Chinese... End of debate! 
no he&#39;s dutc pretty sure when i saw him at madame tussauds in amserdam 
Tiesto is from the Netherlands. Check wikipedia, check his Dutch interviews, etc. now ... shut up, agree with the fact that the Dutch will always rule House music, and LISTEN TO THIS MASTERPIECE :D
He&#39;s néerlandais 
dancke Tiesto dafür ! ! !
Tiesto is Dutch.
(Y)
he&#39;s my brother you see 
look mate .. i was gonna vote up your comment .. until you said you used to hang out with tiesto it&#39;s kinda hard to believe..
I don&#39;t think that is a very good thing to say to germany.
Stop fighting, Tiesto is romanian i grow up with him. On time i kicked him in his face and then he respects me and calls me sometimes and asks how i feel. I was joking:))))))).
Let&#39;s all argue over a great song. Would you guys argue where a Dj is from at one of his gigs? No. So SHUT.THE.FUCK.UP!
his music is more than techno, more than dance, each song is a journey full of emotion. i look up to him as a producer. by the way check out my stuff, i make more then 1 style tell me what u think i am somewhat beginner
:facepalm:
Tiesto is clearly Mongolian! He even rocks the handlebar mustache, wears the fur of a Bactarian Camel, and practices archery from horseback from time to time.
He&#39;s Dutch actually
he&#39;s French you ignorants... --&#39;
samuel barber who made that magical melody tiesto who shaped this protecting the main theme thanks both of you that i have something to listen whenever i need piece of mood
at 2:41 i was shivered like hell!
Come on man You have to know that he is dutch and from the Netherlands You idiot 
Not anymore Armin Van Buuren is the Top #1 Dj now

Platoon !!
Polska przejmujemy! 
*Goes to Wiki* Oh, Netherlands.

Tiesto is God, he is from everywhere and is everything
Probably one of the worst remixes out there. Tiesto has taken a classic and turned it into something quite harsh and forgetful...
Pretty sure he&#39;s out of this world ^ ^
Fuck, i prefer the original too SAMUEL BARBER is the boss
holland rules the dance music industrie...fuck off with you germany and nigerian...only dutch 
prefer the original
thats good to know :)
Tijs Michiel Verwest, OON, known as Tiësto, is a Dutch musician
i have a eargasm !
he is from netherlands, you guys should get the facts right 
Tijs Michiel Verwest, born 17 January 1969),known as Tiësto is a Dutch musician, DJ and record producer of electronic dance music. Although he has used many aliases in the past, he is best known for his work as DJ Tiësto. Search it up on wikipedia. TIËSTO IS DUTCH
The &quot;adagio for strings&quot; is an original piece of the XXth century american composer Samuel Barber
The foundation of DANCE!!!!
In fact he&#39;s Dutch or from the Netherlands :D Cause he&#39;s name is Tijs Michiel Verwest. He&#39;s one of the best Dj&#39;s in Europe. On Wikipedia stands that a lot of votes say that he is the Best Dj in the world. &lt;--- Maybeh. He&#39;s passion is to Mix Songs. And no to put tha cherry on the Pie : He&#39;s Dutch you Ass.
pretty sure he&#39;s dutch.
Get real people, He&#39;s extraterrestrial! Stop Guessing already!

hey gues what hes dutch 
He&#39;s from Narnia

DAMN FUCKING GOOD YEAH ! 
Don&#39;t listen to these people, Tiesto is obviously from Sealand.
Tiesto is obviously from Mars because this song is so fucking amazing :D
I love how the responses have NOTHING to do with the music, but where the man is from. You wanna know where the dude is from? AWESOMENESS!!! That&#39;s where from. 
He&#39;s Lithuanian from Cambodian Croatia of Switzerland&#39;s Denmark
he&#39;s Japanese btw
No. Tiësto was born in the netherlands. Not Romania. Learn your facts before you try and correct people, lol.
It doesn&#39;t have to be compared to the original. And plus its tiesto&#39;s remixed song not yours.
adagio for strings
omg! it&#39;s been such a long since i&#39;ve last listened to this song ! 
he is dutch you fool
its ADAGIO FOR STRINGS from PLATOON

oh...just cruising...
DJ Tiesto should have called this version &#39;fuck you Samuel Barber&#39; instead (sadly, I know most persons won&#39;t get this joke)
both of you (especially you) are literally too stupid to insult

vaya coñazo de tema, está hasta en la sopa
I think this was a great mix some of his best work, the etherals are awesome and the drop is solid as are the bridges, you can dance to it or just chill while you drive. great job!
Tiesto!&lt;3!
Horseshit compared to William Orbit... devout Tiesto fan but this one let him down...
blinding track, never gets old

yea i would classify it as trance as well..

Do you know that anyone can produce or download brilliant beats online at &quot;Beat MaxPro&quot; (google it)? I really enjoyed the video on their website, that might be motivational for you too...
Rubbernecking. Wondering why this shows up when I search for Barber&#39;s music.
Oh wow.
3:43 simply beautyful
One of the best Tiesto&#39;s songs ever!!!
Nothing old school with this track. If you want old school trance go back to 1997,1998. Those where the times. Those days where pure trance!!
troll
I personally enjoy the old school trance like this song. The new trance/techno...not so much. I like this track, sweet misery, lonely and sweet things by Tiesto.
I remember when every videos intro used to look like this :)
Dr Tiesto drug me up 
Holy crap,Tiesto is the best DJ ever.I feel so sad when I listen to this,it&#39;s so perfect.

and there goes the last fuck I give 
Fuckk Offffff
M A C E D O N I A L O V E T I E S T O 
Congratulation for creating the most retarded youtube comment ever posted on a TRANCE video. Again congrats!
It&#39;s trance and there&#39;s nothing forced about it. Tiesto created a masterpiece out of a masterpiece, that&#39;s all there is to it. It&#39;s perfect.
this is my new drug
This has to be one of the best tracks this century!!!... apart from &#39;Just be&#39; (see my channel)
I don&#39;t see how this makes a good dance ore house song. The beat drops out for a long time, it&#39;s rather a somber piece to try and force into this type of music. I think a lot of people like it because the original piece pulls at your heart strings. Might have something to do with the fact that the piece has been used in just about everything from Roosevelt&#39;s funeral, the elephant man, platoon and all kinds of 9-11 specials. If you have been alive in the last 60+ years you&#39;ve heard it somewhere

nobody can say they are a lover of house music unless they have heard this track &lt;3 :) 
It&#39;s an song by Samuel Barber called Adagio for Strings, and it&#39;s an incredibly sad (though very beautiful) orchestral song.
how is the original of this song called? 
havent heard this for ageeeees!reminds me of the old good times,love it! :D

I dont, I clicked it by accident whlie listening to the original, upon hearing I made a comment. But I like that responce.
bester dj in sachn trance ohne worte klasse mucke
Yeah... IF YOU DON&#39;T LIKE don&#39;t listen to it...simple as that
Was that your last physico analyzation test result mate *facepalm*
Tiesto, where did you go wrong with your music. This is so beautiful and now he plays this house garbage. 
*sigh* I know what you ment, I was turning on you, are you what this music breeds, comtempt and a stupidity. What this Dj say and what hes has done are two different things, if he reall respected the original artist he would not have made such pile of shit and riped a few well known verses from the original. sorry but nothing from this genre of music could ever pay respects to a real musician.
respect to you tiesto legend master at work 100 percent perfection 
savage trance tune i have this one in my bage of tricks just waiting to get slamped down on the technics 1210s djsolace
Idiot...your comment is fail. Tiesto made it with respect for the real owner and real song...
I know it is, glad to know I&#39;m not the only who thinks that 
Fail.
Coming to my college soon. UIC!
creamfields tomorrow!! got me right in the mood!!
proud to be DUTCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
P O L S K A !!!!
cant beat this one, just cant
95 Percent of the comments are from people who have never experienced a rave. Wait till you can feel the noise rather then listen to it, now thats something.
I don&#39;t remember this tune, but it&#39;s fantastic
at 4:22 BLOWWW that speakersssss

couldn&#39;t have said it any better :) 
DAMN I REMEMBER HIM PLAYING THAT SONG IN ATHENS 2004 OLYMPIC GAMES EPIC SHOW + THE FIREWORKS there is just no words to describe it 
daily must listen this 
Welcome to vietnam...
Essa música é a melhor!
In che anno ha fatto questa traccia Tiesto??
agree
Great
OLD BUT GOLD!!
This song is the song that got me into trance and old school electronic music. Europe is the spiritual home of all electronic music
Eminem R&amp;B what are you on
i think if Samual Barber is a true Musician and Artist, he is delighted his work has not been put on a dusty plank but is being listened to by youngsters today
keeeeemonnnnn!!! putcha hands up!!! wicked tune!! cud dance al night to this!!
Classic
EPIC in 2012 to !
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1:40 is were i got hard. ^___^
how this classic tune has less than a million views i will never know!
Proper Party tune C&#39;mon everybody put you hands up Make some noise TIESTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FUCKIN LEGEND!!!!
I agree also. The only time I hear it is on a couple dance stations from like midnight-3am, and on college radio stations sometimes. It&#39;s so depressing where music has gone since the 90s/early 2000s. What the hell happened? We actually have a &quot;Generation X&quot; radio station here that plays late 80s/90s/early 2000s hits, and I&#39;ve even started to gain an appreciation for old school hip hop and rap, which I remember hating back then. This next decade will sure blow ass...
pitbull is hot so is this
I agree, mainstream radio sucks balls. We need more stations that play tiesto and trance/other electro music
in Tiesto we trust!!
Do you know that another remix for Adagio for Strings appeared in the 1994 first-person shooter video game, &quot;Rise of The Triad: Dark War&quot;?
Fuck Mainstream songs. Fuck radio&#39;s. Fuck Pitbull, Rihanna, LMFAO, Guetta. Fuck Avicii, Afrojack. Fuck the new Tiesto. THIS IS MINDBLOWING. I want those tracks BACK AGAIN!
thx you are my hero
&quot;in an album called &quot;just be. :)
i swear Eminem is rap LOL 
in which album is this music ?
was listening to this in a tour bus in Germany before anyone would actually admit they listened to trance/techno, im glad the new era of DJing is coming alive so strong. Btw cyall at UMF next year :D
Tiesto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fuuuuuaarrrkkkkkk
This is a crime against the origional
&quot;your logic&quot; - which one exactly? I&#39;ve heard you state opinions, and to me, rather wild ones. Now you&#39;re even claiming you didn&#39;t say what you said? It&#39;s getting more bizarre. You didn&#39;t even hint at any sub-context, so your general statement reads &quot;anyone who doesn&#39;t like this must be close-minded&quot;.
&quot;stating people who think the cover version was botched&quot; This was your initial incorrect presumption. Your OPINION bends my logic and there is nothing I can do to argue that away.
Just by the way: This &quot;hypocrite&quot; accusation, because someone points out flaws in recently observed actions of somebody else in one instance and commited a similar thing in another himself, is also pretty silly, a cheap-shot defense. I mean, it&#39;s basically like claiming that you have or will, never in your life, act presumptuous, a claim which you would have to fulfil to not be a hypocrite yourself, lol. Very amusing, regarding that this is a general human trait, and one can only try not to.
Just in case it eluded you, the place was your first post: stating people who think the cover version was botched, need to &quot;open their fucking mind&quot;. From which follows you think there can&#39;t be another reason why they dislike it, e.g. simply that it sucks (to them anyway), completely understanding what&#39;s going on in the music and being familiar with the type, with no need to &quot;open the mind&quot;. And you even felt the need to emphasize it with profanity. Explain how this is not presumptuous. 
It&#39;s still the same, it&#39;s silly that you call an artist a *moron* if they do have a problem with somebody else using their work in a way they think sucks. And now you say, yeah it&#39;s sorta allright, but don&#39;t you dare *expressing* it? What&#39;s the point then in having the opinion? You don&#39;t make sense, but will conjure up all sorts of twists to bend around the obvious logic to defend your initial presumptuous statement. 
Whether I was being it too or not, that &quot;You are the only one&quot; is a flatout lie. And I already pointed to were you were being presumptuous, all you do all the time is throwing claims, without backup.
I usually only throw insults when somebody upsets me, like the other guy, but you didn&#39;t. Although it&#39;s rarely helpful at all, but tell that a brain that&#39;s pissed :-D
Not sure why you explain you like both, I didn&#39;t touch that question. I was trying to express a general observation made here and there, I thought I was *unspecific enough* ;-) Leaving it in the open what your position in that picture may be - I hadn&#39;t heard anything from you so far that would tempt me to utter speculations. I reckoned you might see at least a bit where I was coming from, as much as you&#39;d like to disagree. It was all I tried to achieve with that post.
I &#39;leave it here&#39; because unlike you, I&#39;m not prepared to write a fucking thesis on this subject. Also i&#39;ve already established you are the one hating, so i&#39;m chill. Lators.
Really? So I clarified that there can only be one reason, in my mind, someone doesn&#39;t like what I like. Fuck i&#39;m good, didn&#39;t even see myself do that.
You are the only one being presumptuous and in calling me so you&#39;ve dubbed yourself a hypocrite also, well done. I claim an artist is a moron IF &#39;they have a problem with another artist drawing from their creativity&#39;. This is something that happens to every single piece of art ever made. AT NO POINT DID I MENTION ENDORSING, nor even liking anything, you can totally hate it for all I care, just don&#39;t go around calling another persons inspiration a disgrace. 
why i cant find the video
From the get go, all you offered is profanity, in your 2nd post you continue with profanity &amp; name calling. Then I used your sort of language. Then you try to play the smart guy &amp; pretend I was out of line with the sort of language you are constantly using - as if hoping nobody would notice. That&#39;s just lame.
&quot;at samuel&quot; No shit. You claimed an artist is a moron if he doesn&#39;t endorse everything anyone does to his work, which is insane. Not hard to get, neither my analogy to illustrate it. I&#39;ll alleviate your dementia: I was also referring to the post where you made clear the only reason you can possibly imagine somebody doesn&#39;t like what you like, is that he&#39;s not open-minded enough. Presumptuous and laughable.
Haha, thank you. Also, I&#39;m not a &#39;Sir&#39; :P
Hmm... lots of long arguments in the comments below... O.o
uhh plz dont use smack and xtc in the same sentance 
oh god i know... it&#39;s so beautiful..... if drugs could be music it would be a combination of heroin and ecstasy......... it&#39;s beautiful......... oh god I can&#39;t w8 to hear it tomorrow.....
If you return to my original comment, sr moronic fucktard of the century, you may note I am having a go at samuel barbers problem with other artists using his work. However since you feel the need to come back at me every morning, i&#39;ll just leave it here. I would explain to you how idiotic you sound, but honestly it would take pages to get it through your head.
Sigh... why do people always feel the need to argue? Just enjoy the music, and if you don&#39;t enjoy it then just move on to a video that you DO enjoy instead of staying here &amp; causing anguish...
My stupid o? Well, I guess people who have a grasp of music that&#39;s wider than &quot;the sounds that come out of the box... me likes! sound nice!&quot;, might partially agree ^^ Certainly hard to find on this &quot;channel&quot;, though :-D I just felt like throwing my 2c in on that particular day, since it&#39;s kind of sad to see this again and again - some talentless hack defiling a piece of art. There have been attemps to render more &quot;modern&quot; versions of classical music far more skilfully carried out than this.
You&#39;re reading things into what I wrote. Who said I don&#39;t listen to any electronic music? It&#39;s about this &quot;song&quot;, and that some average &quot;DJ&quot; copied a musical piece he couldn&#39;t have composed if his life depended on it, without noteworthy own creative input (worse, he butchered it) , and has himself celebrated by a big bunch of ignorant kids, cheering what oh genious music this is. Sure everyone besides knows it&#39;s not his, but it works well enough for him. Stuff like that gets on my nerves.

L E B A N O N BEST SONG EVER!!!!!!! 
To tinkerwithstuff -- sit down u mad keyboard warrior nobody cares about ur stupid o
Words can hardly describe what a disgrace and insult this piece is to the original composer. Turning such a tasteful composition, full of subtleties, into an ordinary, almost average dancing tune. The only thing making it not average is the original composer&#39;s input, take it away, at only a few dirt grains remain, well, and lots of &quot;boom boom boom&quot;, of course. (I&#39;m not generally against skilful re-interpreting original works. The emphasis being on skilful here.)
What an unthougtful knee-jerk response. Just imagine somebody turn your composition into a David Hasselhoff style song, haha. Perhaps you&#39;d be well advised to &quot;open your fucking mind&quot; to what a magnificently deliciuos meal a fresh, steaming dog turd can be. You know, the dog drew from the creativity of the master chef, who artfully composed the fantastic meal... until the stupid dog came along, mindlessly munching away on it in a very crude way.
One of the few sensible comments on Youtube. Well said sir.
Amazing 3 song for all my senses
A musician has a problem with another musician drawing from their creativity? What a moron.
Including Samuel Barber?
3:45 orgasm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
did you seriously just call eminem r&amp;b? LOL
at this moment i honored you as god of the universe sound 
man just fucking awesome 
Tiesto? You are a legend.
Someone actually gets it. 
Polska!! :)
FINLAND
Barber&#39;s original is a masterpiece no doubt about it, but you shouldn&#39;t say &quot;Oh Tiesto ruined the song with this piece of shit&quot; because he didn&#39;t. Some people didnt (and still mightn&#39;t) know that there is an original version of this song and Tiesto made some people find the original masterpiece whilst also giving it a new modern twist. He took a brilliant song and for trance / electro fan&#39;s he made it better. So I salute Tiesto for this song!
THIS SONG IS GODLY! FEEL IT!
Barber&#39;s original piece is fantastic. So is this. Both in different ways, and of course the original always wins out, but this is the one song that has kept me listening to electronic music to this day. However Tiësto managed to create something great in a different way from something already beautiful.
Best dj song ever made
i love music in general, it&#39;s my only escape...classical, metalcore (as i lay dying), trance, dubstep(arkasia), R&amp;B(eminem), alternative(incubus), dance, sappy love songs (adele), indie(mumford&amp;sons), even oldies(frank sinatra) and reggae(fidel nadal). point is, i take in a song and appreciate what it has, every song is unique for a reason, even a cover. this track by Tiesto is orgasmic for a lack of a better word. if you don,t fancy it, then don&#39;t diss about it, just move on. :) peace!!
@TheSTATiiCchannel wow now ur illiterate? i said music &quot;jogs your innerself because you&#39;re drugged up&quot; not because you drugged up. take ur own advice and proofread ur own comments before correcting others. :D
blocked by the way :)
you don&#39;t know when to stop. Go to the music you like and stop saying shit about the music other people like. all im saying.
awww is someone mad? AHAHAHAHAHA
your opinion saying trance isn&#39;t the &quot;best&quot; thing to happen to music doesn&#39;t mean &quot;jack shit&quot; eather. And for you to say that trance &quot;jogs your inner self&quot; because you are &quot;loaded up on drugs&quot; is a disgrace. you don&#39;t see me going on the music i don&#39;t like and saying &quot;you have to be retarded to enjoy this music&quot;. please, don&#39;t click the video if you are only going to write shit about it. listen to your own music that you like. thanks &quot;geez....todays ppl -,-&quot; 
Dj Tiesto el mejor Csm xd&#39;
Fuck I love Tiesto. Wish he&#39;d come to melbourne and do a gig. I&#39;d be in the front row. Best song he&#39;s made. Ever.
SMOKE WEED EVERY DAY
great dj awesome music nuff said 
As the world changes so does music. Just because we make it a different way doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easier and it sure a fuck doesn&#39;t mean it sucks.
Guy&#39;s the dislike button it&#39;s not a download button !
all music is good once its done right
Oh hey, here&#39;s an idea: stop trying to argue with me via YouTube and get a life. We&#39;re all entitled to our opinions. You can comment on a Mozart video and express your sentiment towards it if you&#39;d like as well.
Go suck of Mozart then and stop dissing others musical interests!
the only reason why trance &quot;jogs your inner self&quot; is cuz you&#39;re loaded up on drugs. anything will &quot;jog your inner self&quot; when you&#39;re high. and no trance is not the &quot;best&quot; thing to have ever happened to music. thats just your opinion which really doesnt mean jack shit. &quot;geez....todays ppl -,-&#39;&quot;
best song yet :) 
amazing song
It&#39;s annoying to look down at the comments and see people arguing about what music is best. Everyone has their own opinion and in mine; Classical bores me, as does rock, metal and screamo. I prefer techno, dance and trance. Doesn&#39;t mean my opinion is right, neither is anyone else&#39;s. Everyone has their own taste, and people need to learn how to deal with that instead of trying to start arguments over the internet. If you don&#39;t like trance remixes so much, don&#39;t click on a remix video then. Simple
mmmmooooooccccccc!!!!!!!! 
This track is AWESOME.
I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re being sarcastic/trolling or if you&#39;re being completely serious. To call trance &quot;one of the greatest thing that has happened to music&quot; is an abomination. I don&#39;t even see how synthetically produced beats have the right to be called music. It&#39;s really annoying to search for a piece and the top results are trance remixes. Btw, I&#39;m not pretending to like classical music. I am a classically trained violinist/trumpetist; classical music has been my life since I was 7 years old.
OH MY GOD! I&#39;m freakin OUUUUT!!! *O*
jaaaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzddddddddddddddddaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
kurwa ta nuta daje chec do myslenia 
3.45 amazing like this
This song is what made me fall in love with electronic music. Anyone saying it&#39;s a disgrace should open their fucking minds. 
@Jumper76Anton there are plp in this world that cant appreciate creativity
Transformed, yes. Better, no. 
Ta piosenka powinna kandydowac do hitu WSZECHCZASÓW! &lt;3
I agree! 
Ajć &lt;3
poor samuel barber
sucks to suck, dont listen to it then
&lt;3333333333333333333333
Then why the fuck do you even listen to it when you don&#39;t like trance?
tiesto covered it well,samuel barber is excellent composer!
da fuck is this shit? i just puked in my mouth. fucking trance artists ruin everything. don&#39;t touch orchestral music!
nederland drugs voor allemaalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll yehhhhhhhhhhhhh tiesto.thanks from brussels
I prefer Suburban Train. More effort went into that track. This track plays and edits the same sample with lots of distortion and other effects to hide its limited creativity. Perhaps 2 or 3 sub-tunes could have been composed/sampled to complement the main sample from Samuel Barber. It would have made it a more complete and interesting track. 
tiesto just made it better
would this be considered trance?
It&#39;s been changed so people who listen to different music can enjoy it too, it&#39;s music, it&#39;s not to be taken with such seriousness that people get insulted through their personal taste.Yes alot of people might not know of Samuel Barber but his work lives on through Tiesto&#39;s personal interpretation. For what you may or may not know about Tiesto he&#39;s a great DJ and is recognised for that not just this one song but many others. Just relax, and let people have their music, it&#39;s all some people have.
Fuck off you imbecile, music is always being mimicked and transformed into something better, If it wasn&#39;t then music would be shit, shut up.
fenomenal!!! 
How dare you disgrace the name of Samuel Barber with this crap. Barber&#39;s Adagio For Strings is one of the most beautiful and glorious pieces of music of all time and has been recognized as such. This is a pale imitation. The Adagio for Strings is meant to be Adagio (slow) and for strings. This is fast and not played by strings. Not to mention the fact that the Adagio is something that just cannot be improved upon. You can&#39;t get great by taking heavenly creations and crapping on them.
real trance? what bollocks
Admito que Tiesto la hizo bonita, pero originalmente no es de el. El simplemente la modifico, la verdad que es su original compositor es SAMUEL BARBER.

1 dislike was Samuel Barber himself and the rest was him bouncing up and down in his coffing.

42 peoples speakers must not they have been working either that or their ears weren&#39;t!
Mate, you have no idea
Same song title?
Vejamos
we need 41 condoms and a time machine....
Hardly a rip off - kept the original title and the mood of the original, if anything Tiesto should be praised for bringing classics to the masses :) 
I realise and love both, that cool yeh?
&lt;3 ! 
Agree. And that Armin Van Burren made a remix before Tiesto. Love em both though.
it&#39;s a remix, yeah. i knew this from the beginning
You don&#39;t say....
There&#39;s another cool version on the soundtrack for the movie Kevin &amp; Perry go large
this is still good but william orbit is the best version in my opinion.
I want more of this shit
Trance &lt;3 Oooohhh Yeah, the best of the techno music ! :D ^^
yeah ripping of good songs.
The original and this are great, though~! ^^
i know it is but its still a bad ass remix by tiesto 
william orbit! the master who creates this piece of art! 
old classical music never die! so, stay cool. dont feel sorry.. live the music!
who cares bout ur original bollox this is the trance anthem simple.....no if buts or maybees throw ur lighters up and enjoy perfection 
Soo true
Tiesto&#39;s theme tune
It&#39;s not a rip of Samuel Barber&#39;s original. It&#39;s a remix of it. Before Tiesto remixed it, Ferry Corsten did a remix. 
One M0:00RE Time :D
SO HARDCOREEEEE
It&#39;s also quite sad that people don&#39;t care if you point it out. Wait, I am one of them.
No matter what.. The best Tiesto track
one of the best songs period.....tiesto is a genius adagio and traffic are timeless
what do u mean people dont realise of course they do!! haha obviously u dont realise its his ability to turn a legendary old classical tune into a modern day famous one!!...muppet!!! lmfao
Charlie Sheen is proud of you.
Dafoe, Berenger, Sheen... war
Or rather, it was the featured theme in Platoon. And that&#39;s what it reminds me of.
The violin part was from the 1986 movie Platoon; search &quot;platoon theme&quot;
dj tiesto , la pineda pacha en espagne en aout 
blew my mind 
4:23 &lt;3
Some Beats Tiesto Well Done :)
So true!
thanks :D yeaaah seems tiesto did his own little mix. happy music listening! : )
good old days :) 
who gives a **** its an amazing tune!!!!
Its quite sad that so many people does not realize this is a rip of a old classical song
RIP Sgt. Elias - Platoon xD
2:41 just yess...
i prefer V.O 
fantastic music it takes me in different dimension (music) (dance)
Every time i see this title i&#39;m like does it say Addicted to strings? :P
Guru Josh Project - Infinity

if anyone knows the song names on this video: watch?v=Or34AErbOb4 please message me or reply back to this comment!! thanks!! 
so do you like tiesto&#39;s new style? or what do u think? he still plays some of his &quot;old stuff&quot; sometimes 
love trance!!! &lt;3
yes this is real absolutetly!
The one by william orbit brings more emotions, but this one is cool too.
Classic trance, nothing better!
NEDERLANDSE COMMENTS BOVEN AAN AUB!!! TIESTO IS VAN ONS... DAAR MOGEN WE TROTS OP ZIJN ;)
I LOVE THAT XYJA MUZIKI !! PooooCCCCiiiiiiiiiiyaaaa !!!!
One of thr best songs of Tiesto 
i think i&#39;ve made all those views during these years...
4:22 for the shivers...on X! (Y) :D
this isn&#39;t adagio?? this is TECHNO!!
Yeah it did the same thing with me. Best DJ in the world.
Thos song sends shivers down my spine at 2:05
The best song ever, I don&#39;t even care! DJ TIESTO&#39; is an absolute legend so whoever hates, just... Piss off
I&#39;m asian yes! 8) 
1285 people listen real music !!!!!! and 26 people lisen justin bieber :D
Idk know it&#39;s the song, or the story I imagine when I listen to it but this song always brings a tear to the corner of my eye.
26 people need to fukin get a grip and turn justin beiber off and listen to some real music 
hoy me queme
it was originally an classical orchestral song, and Tiesto covered it.
we played this in orchestra!
4 EVER !! 
i thought tiesto was the original creator....? or have i been wrong for the last 10 years? :S 
from*
not for a long long time ago : 1936
this song is from Samuel Barber (Adagio for strings) wonderful
forever today is an album or an song??
Tiësto in his golden years, this is an stays the best eletronic music ever! 
adagio for strings is classical music from a long time ago :L tiesto just remixed it :L:L:L
this is the real tiesto!
ta muza kojarzy mi sie z koncem swiata to jest de best!!!
This is TRANCE, not techno,,, know the difference
zajebiste!!!!!!!!!!
...True, but amazing how some producers can relate classical music to trance, or any form of electronica music. 
giant fail.
Tiesto ever forever
POLSKA KURWA!!!!!!!!
Trance, Not Techno
TIESTO DIDNT CREATE THIS: Listen to : &quot;insert crap singer here&quot;: &quot;insert crap song here&quot;
Adoro essa musica, a batida é perfeita!
TIESTO DIDNT CREATE THIS: Listen to: Samuel Barber: Agnus Dei
.WoW. thumbs up if you listen this in 2012 .WoW.
your face is fucking shit?
Fucking Shit!!!!!! 
Hopefully future gens have better taste in music than we do now haha 
Fair enough that is true... but centuries from now what music will be remembered for antiquity? Justin Bieber, Ke$ha, Lil Wayne? 
Ibiza, Sommer 2005 scheisse geil!!!
@ ExpEarthTravel I agree that there is no real comparison to the original &quot;Classical Masters&quot; but how many younger music lovers have now listened to the original classical piece, after hearing Tiesto&#39;s interpretation? I wonder what Mozart or Beethoven would have done with a Synthesizer or Fruity Loops? Just a thought ;)
1.25 to 2.40 = pure euphoria 
class 
Justin bieber Very Easy Easy Normal Hard Very Hard Extreme Pro Awesome Asian Chuck norris Dj Tiesto
old school :)
very bad.. don&#39;t feel nothing..
But is this not a masterpiece &quot;dance song&quot;? Music has evolved and i believe this is just as intricate, grand, and emotional as classical pieces. 
I wonder if in a couple centuries This stuff will be looked at like we look at Mozart or Beethoven as master piece classics!

classic tune
wut
ale máš to podobne od jedne pisničky ale to je blbost aby si kopíroval
hmm ujdeto, ne kecam je to dobry
Like if you repeat this song more than once 
I think when people say &quot;Techno&quot; they aren&#39;t referring to the genre of techno, but are using a blanket term for all electronic music, ya dig? Its common among the unlearned. I mean if i were an ignorant nob, I&#39;d probably do the same thing... Just a thought though.
-Come on guys... Dnt talk like that bout Guetta... Each one makes the kind of music that represents him and his feelings... I suppose Guetta is fellin kinda stupid though... :p While Tiesto over here is felling EPIC... :D
i think traffic isa litttle better tho. 
zzzzzzzzzzzajebissssssteeeeeeeeeee
Techno to me is anything with a good beat and made electronically :P
Shut Up And Listen
K BUENOOOOOOO 
süper turkiyeden hello
Techno is a form of electronic dance music (EDM)[1] that emerged in Detroit, Michigan in the United States during the mid to late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word techno in reference to a genre of music was in 1988.[2][3] Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built. --from wikipediia for the two that are arguing, but please continue, its very entertaining
fantastic !
skit skit skit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No, you are an idiot for believing something that outright isn&#39;t true. Idiot.
Thumps up if your listening to this song in 2012 :) This song still got swaga !

Wonderful!
When he got hard
don&#39;t be sad cause it&#39;s over smile because it happened. Imagine trance never had a tiesto
His best days!
When I think &quot;trance&quot;, this is a first track that comes into my mind &lt;3<br>masterpiece
Mike Tyson
This is definitely my Number 1 get up and go.....
Such a shame tiesto is a fraud , all his tunes were made by ghost producers and made to the style of music that was popular at the time ! That&#39;s why he plays what he plays now he&#39;s just a puppet and a face for the music no real passion , the true legends that deserve respect are the ghost producers
Pure Masterpiece 🙌🏼🙌🏼
I feel my soul

This Is Urban Train Off vocal?
❤️
I never want this moment to end
When Tiesto was at his finest
Joya musical. Remember me my old time raving in Holland in Gabbers parties or Spain (radical) , Trance was so good also for real oldschool Gabbers like hardtrance too. In the mornings there was nothing better with blue ice( meth) hahaha it s like wake up in heaven with Trance at that time. New generations will never understand our time partying hard.<br>I proud of my youth!! It s in my back but never forget it. We were united as one.
Back when Trance had a soul. Now it&#39;s all over-produced, uninspired, cookie-cutter guff.
yo
In the vibe gyeaaaa!!!
Greets from Poland
Any മല്ലൂസ് ..?
❤️
Years later I&#39;m still on this journey 🛤️🚅 . His music will forever move each and every single person.
I had a dvd of the concert where he played this with the children of orpheus choir. Freaking genius. WHAT HAPPENED TIESTO?
When Tiesto was Tiesto....
🔥💯🙏💓
One of Tiesto&#39;s best before he sold out to the generic cacophony.
This track was field tested in real time and if you were there you knew immediately this is his best work
best track he did, crap now
Best sound ever. So much emotion packed in one song
Welcome to my Suburban Train. We are currently traveling at 135 beats per minute, we will be at our destination in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=9m23s">9:23</a>. Please enjoy this awesome ride!
Absaloot blinder
What a tune Tiestio is amazing DJ 🎧🎛🎚
20 years old yet such a high quality
Question is this song copyrighted I want to know because I want to use it in videos???
2021 like Brasil
This track is in the trance hall of fame!
Of course
Yes.
Tune!!!
This came in at number 50 on a state of trance top 1000. Also Tiesto placed the number 4 and number 2 track of all time. He should have got number 1. I’m serious! Oh and this from a dj who has not played trance since 2008. That is amazing!
Genre: Trance<br><br>the real one
I think this was one of Tiesto&#39;s tracks and is very wonderful song to jam too
The build up from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=4m00s">4:00</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=5m01s">5:01</a>... followed by an explosion of emotion.
That build up is non-existent in todays dance music.
car bad; train good
If you had the privilege of hearing this is a club when it first came out, you should consider yourself very lucky. We never knew just how lucky we were, it is simply a masterpiece. Luckily we get to relive that moment over and over again
100% agree. Trouble with a track like this as epic as it is it's not really a nightclub tune. It goes on a bit long and not right for that atmosphere. This track appeals to old croaks like us sitting at home and feeling like your in a better place and dreaming you are a better person👍🏿👍🏿
To be HONEST, TIESTO SHITS on everyone with this ONE TRACK!!!!!! It was Well-Engineered and produced!!
A journey through concrete &amp; straight lines. Wishing it was all somehow different......👌
2022 still sounds better ❤️
A commercial break in the middle of the song gtfo with that my god
Wish we still be able to go to places like this.Its boring now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=4m52s">4:52</a>!!!!!! La mejor parteee!!!!
This is a prototrance track. A blue print for the genre. Pure, unadulterated, proper trance. The first time I heard this I knew Tiesto was going to be a permanent fixture in the Trance firmament. Say what you will about his wayward career choices, he has definitely left his mark on our little genre&#39;s history.
Whot a master pice
As fare as trance hose this will take some beating
Whot a absaloot banger
Never forget
One of Tiësto ‘S best tracks !
2021 year

This song is so fking hardcore 90s, its unbelieveable! It takes me hardcore back to 1999-2004 in spain, when my father was a famous dj and just my whole life living right in the party scene everyday when i was only 3-5 years of age
It takes me back to a time when I was popping ecstasy like smarties.I got home and listened to this to chill out!!
Who is your father bro
Who is here because of armin van buuren?
A State Of Trance TOP 1000 #50
During the intro, did anyone else go cross eyed because the bass kick didn&#39;t match anything?!?🤪
Melhor trip
Must have smashed the like button 1m times now
The music today can’t touch the tunes we listen to back in the day,that was a great time to be alive 😎
2001: wow this is good <br>2021: oh shit, this is a masterpiece
@Dragaan And i'm not trying to defend Tiesto, in my mind he topped in the year of 1999, but Kid Vicious is listed as producer on this track. Maybe your right, that noone knows about it, but thats just the way it is. Bob Dylan wrote a ton of songs, and gave them away, only to see massive hits in the hands of whomever recorded it. Same with Lennon/McCartney, they gave away a ton of songs also. "Light my fire".. The Doors.. Same story..
@Dragaan Kid Vicious has credits as producer on this track....? That sounds like he had something to do with it, it don't sound like Tiesto ripped him of.
This makes me think of what music tiesto still could be making if he stayed in this genre, and it makes me sad that he didn't. R. I. P. Trance legend Tiesto
Beauty
Now, this is A CLASSIC
yep
masterpiece done by not tiesto :)
Exactly!
One of the best masterpiece!
Yea, too bad barely anyone knows who actually produced it. Read some of the comments under this track/video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusbYxhFBe8 I always knew this sounded waaaay too similar to Re-Form, ever since this track first "came out" (under tiesto's name). I didn't realize til recently the history behind a lot of this stuff ("Tiesto" stuff...)
Tiesto
ASOT Top 1000 - No. 50 .... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23asot1000">#ASOT1000</a>
@Yasha easily had recognition way before the asot list, tiesto set the benchmark back in the day
Glad it got that recognition
It&#39;s a Hymne 🌀👁️👄👁️
2031 &lt;3 <b>hi from BAKU</b>
2021 !!! the world needs more trance
This would be great for an opening scene in a Bond movie
Yeah, it would be back in 2002, not so much today.....
Jauss u killed it their in end with stipid add
Listening to this on a train is much better
Yes,yes! I found it! Woop woop this song came to me in my dream. 🤯
This is the most cleverly composed trance track i have ever listened to. And i enjoy it very much.<br>Listen properly. Listen properly and you will be able to see with your ears, because there is something great happening here.
2021 y sigue siendo lo mejor de lo mejorr
The original trance, the real Tiësto... Enjoying... Dec. 31, 2020.
God damn this track still smacks in 2020

I mean Roland van Gelderen ofcourse
It’s almost the end of this dramatic 2020 year. We have survived a pandemic named corona-virus. This music remind me how lucky we are. Thank you DJ Tiesto👍🏼
Let the DJ now how you&#39;re feeling!
What happened to you Tiesto? :(
He forgot his roots and became tooo commercial. Money became more important than the music. He was the best and i wish he would come back. 😕
TRANCE ON AND TRANCE OFF CLASS One VINYL.
Sounds very Chicane ..
Nothing absolutely nothing beats this breakdown. Was like a nuclear explosion going off on the dancefloor. You&#39;d get people in tears.
U were there. U wouldn’t know that Unless u lived it. Respect... Stay safe. 👍🏻
A true trance legend of legends this tune. A literal trance journey of many fond memories.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=4m10s">4:10</a> nice bass joo
The train on the cover is a Canadian Pacific Dash 9-44CW.

I always associate trance with trains, IDK why. Listening to trance on a train trip is like the best feeling ever.
It saddens me that trance has we all once knew is now a thing of our past<br>It seems we’ve faded into the shadows or lurking in dark corners.<br>But as long as we have our memories of big nights and great friends<br>Classic tunes like this allows us to step back into the light<br>Just for a while anyway.<br>I’ll never forget trance the way it was<br>I’ll never forget my time<br>I hope none of u true trance brothers and sisters <br>Won’t either... stay safe.
This tracks quality is insane 20 yrs after it came out. Top 5 all time to me.
in my top 5 too quality song
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Hele şuna ya
He&#39;ll make a come back. Trance style. And blow us all away again.
2020
Anyone else only 13 here ? Haha
It is still my favourite song and it’s 20 years old my favourite tune of tiestos
I know OLD IS GOLD but things changes over time so ACCEPT THE CHANGE or you won&#39;t survive in this world
He made some amazing tracks, this is the best, nowadays just copying the bullshit
musik to die
Ronald van Gelderen better have gotten his money for creating this.
Tiesto too
Just sublime!
Wow this is Tiësto? It sounds deep and tide...
This is the one and only original tiesto. When he was at its best. Still is a top class DJ but his style changed over time.
What a tuunnne ♥️ like the comments still playing 2020 Tiësto u legend the build up still haunts me since 2001 ♥️👊
Красавчег
I greet you with frangipanis as I spin the decks on my horse. This tune.
Come back again old tiesto..:((
Bak EĞER ingilizce bilmiyorsan senin validene özel ders veririm
Melody has no way!
this didnt hit me like a train like I was somehow expecting...
Try looking at Tiësto as a brand rather than a person with Tijs Verwest as the DJ and face fronting it. <br><br>Ronald Van Gelderen, Cor Fijneman, Denis Waakop Reijers, Geert Huinink, Alco Lammers are the main names and talent behind many of those great Tiesto tracks and remixes you know.<br><br>As for Suburban/Urban Train...well I guess Ronald Van Gelderen IS Tiësto here, and will have received payment in the same way any ghost producer should (as well as being credited).
RvG didn't produce this song he is credited because it is based on his Kid Vicious - Reform track. Tiesto & Dennis Waakop produced it, a production and writing credit is given to RvG as a courtesy. RvG never ghost produced for Tiesto.
My thoughts exactlly, his concerts all the things he do... it has something to do with his charisma.
Just found out that this track was originally written and produced by Ronald van Gelderen under the alias and title: Kid Vicious- &quot;Re-form&quot;. Apparently Tiesto was just a front figure and didnt write any music himself.
Yes Tiesto has lots of music!
This is often the case, but see it as teamwork instead of just 1 man.
Takes me right back, Global Gathering, Crasher, Passion Coalville to name but a small few, great times as a youth!
Lo nuevo del DJ Tiesto......VAMOOH....VAMOOOH
Didnt think soo much about it before but I have started to love it now in 2020!
Cuando tiesto hacia buena musica
Agosto 2020 ♥🔥😱
368 with no taste
Back when Tiesto made good music...
I remember it well,clubbing @ Coliseum in nj,good times
Tiesto took a ticket and never came back, sad.
Absolute pukka jezzz love that style of Tiesto 90&#39;s ❤️💪
The diesel loco is freight, not passenger suburban))
I love tiesto
2020
И даже Ухань нашла
Thank God I was there.
The best Trance and Progressive track in the whole universe
The best dj
Tiesto was absolutely on fire when he released this track. For me this is when classic trance was at it&#39;s peak.
@Andy N he did write a lot of the good stuff too remember.

When there is noone to express your feelings to, playing trance and losing yourself into it totally seems so magical
Indeed 💙🎧🎵🙌🏽
❤️
YEP!
kids of today look and see this tune is over 9 mins long and think &quot;what?&quot;<br>but we know it&#39;s not long enough
TREN SUBURBANO 2020!
Good grief this one takes me back...smack bang in uni days when trance ruled the waves..memories that will never be forgotten!
❤️❤️❤️
the part from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=6m20s">6:20</a> on and at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=6m52s">6:52</a> where the tune dips slightly always gets me - my all time fav tune, i was listening to this the moment i crashed my car and ripped it into 2 pieces
They really don&#39;t make them like this anymore, don&#39;t they?
I would lay on my lounge floor at 15 with the lights off looking out to the stars listening to this over and over. It took me on a journey then, and almost gets me choked up with emotion hearing it now 17 years on. So powerful.
💙
tbh I see this in a gay club lol
@Rik Ver Mar I'm straight but it sounds likke that 2 me XD
youve been to too many gay clubs
After all these years, still gives me chills, amazing buildup to climax
All aboard the nostalgia train. Peak tiesto was untouchable.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=3m30s">3:30</a> it is awesome
One of the best beats out there
this one is so emotional ❤
Nice train bro.
The start of this sounds out of sync
I do too
seems like there is only 2 of us noticing that
I m here during lockdown
Put speed to 1.5 - You have Trance Techno<br>Put speed to 0.75 - You have chilling house
I guy that made these kind of tracks in the past can’t just go and make shitty musik in the present
fuck me.....I could go a swedger listening to that
Just like &quot;controlled&quot; drugs for the ears🤣🤣🤣
latinos (LIKE) escuchando un buen track en 2020
Tiësto will always be a trance god!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=8m55s">8:55</a> till the end = pure goosebumps
I miss DJ TIESTO.
I&#39;m a tiesto fan so he is always going to sound good to me.. will always be a fan,, 2020 and beyond
Tiesto suburban train goooooood song. Tiesto good dj
I need a time machine pls for that moment of 2001
Nostalgia! 17 years went by so quick
I&#39;m listening to tiesto since I a teenager, <br>The tracks he came up with in the late 90s and early 2000 got him the legendary status.<br>On most of the tracks ppl just be commenting some negative shit about his new music (I&#39;m not a fan of his new music either)<br>But we got to understand he is fucking 51 years old man, u can&#39;t produce or listen to same kind of music ur entire life.<br>With time the music taste changes. That&#39;s a fact.
για μενα εινε ενας και μοναδικος οοοοοο νουμερο 1
i started listening to tiesto back in 99, now im into progressive house/tech house
Vieläkin ihan yyberi päräytys. Eli kaikki Danse Trance hihhulit,So some Respect 4.TIESTO!!!!!!
The old Train never die , only tiesto his change the stile. Tiesto why left Trance , why left your real fan . Its 2020 and This still , afther like one mounth . Old by Gold. Afther 19 year The Train is alive
i am 38 and now i remember that year 1998 2004 . The 6 year of Gold Trance. Only Real Trancer fell This moment. TIESTO, ATB, FERRY COSTER, ARMIN VAN BURREN, SOLAR STONE, PAUL VAN DIE, AND MANY MORE . But Tiesto was my favorite. Now is a joke a kidd . This is not Tiesto today.

Canción IMPRESINDIBLE para tomar el metro matutino. <br><br><br>Chile.
Suburban train flight 743 lethal industry sparkles karma of painters what’s great tracks Tiesto has under his belt can’t forget love on fire traffic aswell Phoenix from flumes sinead o Conner hope spelling is right
Athena, The Tube, Dallas 4PM, When She Left, Theme From Norefjell. Also, the legendary songs he did with Ferry Corsten under the Vimana and Gouryella name, the songs he did with Benno De Goeij under Kamaya Painters and of course the two times he teamed up with Armin under the name Major League and Alibi.
2020 this is still amazing 👍
The train gives you the clue, its taking you on a journey like Underworlds Dark and Long. Pure class. Best track he ever did.
Excelentes melodías tiempos aquellos nunca volverán
rakion
(R.I.P.) Trance Master 4 Life.
This brings back the memories of when I was a kid forgetting about the world listening to Tiësto.
Good old classic
Esto era música elotronica buena forever Tiestóooóooóoóoo naver wan 🤙🏻🏆👍🏻👌🌏😎👏👂🔊🎶🎵🎚🎚📣
Es 2020 y está joya musical me sigue gustando como cuando el primer día que la escuché ♥️
yo no entiendo tiene 2 versiones Urban y Suburban o que, las 2 son buenas pero prefiero la otra de 10min también está la vocal.
Una de tantas que de verdad te llevan a otro nivel
Esque la buena música nunca pasa de moda, llegará el 2050 y seguirás sintiendo lo mismo, moriremos y las vibraciones de ésta música seguirán recorriendo el universo, ya que las ondas de radio se esparcen al más allá jajaja
Best Tiësto track ever!!
I met the guy in Vegas hes koo. He appreciates his fans.
This song is special to me. Late at night I was at home listening to an old trance, waiting for a call from the hospital. In the middle of this song I had a phone and I can hear. Mr, you can come now, it is time, it begins. With a mystical sense of this song, I went to the hospital to welcome my daughter on this world . Never forget
Gratulacje 👶🙂
2020 here
Still legend.
forever tiesto
I think I might set this as my alarm in the morning
👏
This takes me back, so many good memories. Still sounds amazing. The only difference is I&#39;m old now!
I&#39;ll always associate this song with driving at night, because I first heard it on the radio when I was driving home from a closing shift back in 2002, I love songs that can do that.
Any good song should have a memory to it.
To me it reminds me Tiësto in Concert II, I can almost hear the chorus at the back
Tune
Masterpiece... 🎧
Epic.
I listened to this on the bus in 8th grade, still one of my favorite songs @ 31 years old.
masterpiece
You can make your dreams come true!!
Tiesto more tracks like this please nomore crap
Why tiesto why
The Train are Coming
What a tune ❤️
2019 anyone?

Now this is what you call trance ! Tiesto king of trance takes your mind and soul to a next level relaxes your mind.

This is one of the most beautiful all-time favourite trance tracks. It&#39;s such an honour to have music like this.
The one and only Tiesto&#39;s track that i fancy back in the day, but1 track was just enough
omg .....still like this tune ... always the best best hits of 90s
The locomotive in the cover looks like a CP AC4400CW
Yep a good old GE
and nobody know all the Tiesto tracks was made by Geert Huinink aka Photon Project ;)
just came here to read the tiesto was good before he sold out comments
El mejor dj de la historia te extrañaremos antiguo tiesto.
The false drop is missing from this version!
Half of all the views is probably mine xD
Zlatno doba trance-a!!
@Zrinko Radeljic Teško stari :\
Da se bar ponovi :/
Is this tech trance?
Nop. This is classic trance
Back when Tiesto was God on the Trance genre . That era , nobody could have competed with him
On LSD For the first time right now (19 years old) my god trance is a good one to listen too<br><br><br><br>Trip date : 15th September 2019
@1986 actually I've quit now LSD was last on my list 😂 but I appreciate the advice keep spreading it
Tiesto number one DJ !
Slam Dance 1000 &gt; goosebumps
Fuck, this is the 1st time I hear this one from Tiësto, much love

Que temazo!
Más de 10 años, escuchando.... 2019
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=6m39s">6:39</a> you feel the train is going... AMAZING
Tiesto!
The mid 1990s - late 2000s was the best time for trance music.
Damn Tiesto was good before!🕺
Can anyone recommend me music close to this? I have been looking for a long time..
Search for classic trance on google m8
tiesto - lethal industry
Ну мог же раньше!!!
Comic gate remix ftp
for anyone who likes a slow build up ...
This track will never die, pure classic!
I &#39;grew&#39; out of trance music and happily went into a techno, house, minimal route a long time ago. Whatever. It&#39;s been many years since I last listened to this track and jeez, honestly. It&#39;s still a weapon. Obsession is also another great track from this era of Tiesto!
Close your eyes and listen. Let the music take you on a journey, to when trance music was at its peak. We dared to dream, and at the weekend, sometimes for 1 night only, our dreams came true.
WHAT THE FUCK!!! I came across this song, was recorded on a cd over ten years ago the cd and I was in search for it since back than! One of the best tracks ever!
Sorry, but this is not the original mix. The breakdown is missing the most important element of this track and that&#39;s the false build up.
still magic in 2019!!!
Good job mister!
2019 ! 😊😊🤔
wow, when i first heard this when this was new, MP3 compression was nothing like it is today, hearing it on youtube its almost like listening to a completely different song<br><br>wait, this is definitely not the exact same &#39;original mix&#39; that existed 18 years ago....
Train of geant train raning and take first vision of technological domination birth of second electric power speed and invisible

Tiesto!!! If you see this, I have one question for you!! Why??! 😔😔😔😔
Love this one j j
Off topic but I think that&#39;s a ac6000 from G.E (General Electric) in the Canadian Pacific railway. But still what an amazing song!
This was and still is an absolute masterpiece.
Theory: Real Tiesto was murdered and got replaced by an impostor Tiesto
I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be true with all that's going on in the world today. DJ Tiesto was a real light in the darkness. The illuminati hates this. God bless.
the tranciest track of all time! pure masterpiece!
2019 &lt;3
I love it.
That hi hat at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=0m41s">0:41</a> fucking activates my inner autistic self woooo!! ttcttctttctcttctcttctcttct
I listen to this everyday.
So much energy and power and a well structured tune from start to finish what&#39;s happened to trance and dance music nowadays kids of today just don&#39;t no ☹
This one gives me anxiety
god... how I miss Tiesto&#39;s insane 140BPM
Dit is de beste trance ooit
I don&#39;t like that one ear piercing note
I think&#39;ing this is something from someone Who is not SOS but nerly or närliggande....... Nu. 🙏 P&amp;K fr. 7 👍. Hi hi ho hope JA aaa&#39;a endlessly. Love. P&amp;K. So&#39;fare........ OK 👌. Bekräfta gärna. Kram 🙏. Största Allvar. STOLTZ!
Trance music replaced ecstasy!
2019
Please be trance dj again !!
Please Tiesto, come back to trance!
This is when Tiesto was really good. He completely sold out. I understand you have to make money but why change your style completely! I guess he wanted to. Idk. I love his old stuff.

amazing and beauty track
i wanna cry
I love zat music...
///||Just memories!!! Used to listen to this back in the early 2000&#39;s. I remember having it on CD and listening to it on my Discman and CD Player back in those days :D :D {~~~{{{~~~It really takes me back to that time. This type of music was truly huge back then. Pre-Internet 2.0, Pre-Smart Phone..those were different times for sure :D If you told me back then that one day in the future I&#39;d listen to this track on a giant online Video Library called YouTube I wouldn&#39;t believe it :D {{{//It was so long ago, I&#39;m trying to remember. Everyone had their own mp3 library and we would burn CD&#39;s from the mp3&#39;s. There was Peer to Peer sharing...but it was more disorganized and chaotic.//Now you can pretty much listen to every song ever made on YouTube, it really is insane to think how much it&#39;s all changed in about 15 years.{{{ I suppose the only downside is that the songs are less glorified. Back then, a single CD, <i>A limited amount of data by today&#39;s standards</i> with like 10 songs was important and amazing. Nowadays, with the information overload it just doesn&#39;t mean what it used to. |||///It&#39;s the digital information age after all! Access to a wealth of information like never before!////Great song!! I&#39;ve always loved the atmosphere it creates. Dark, Introspective and Thought Provoking. ///-|_|-|_|-
Almost an ASMR track for me this one. Remember it from my uni days, and still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end at the various break points. Sadly this is no more. The real Tiësto passed away about a decade ago. All that&#39;s left is a soleless, mainstream shell.
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷 🇹🇷
Lowe 🌎💙💙💙💙😘
the best tema
Woe cool Track
Class tune shame Tiesto has gone more into mainstream dance/house miss the good old days of trance/techno as I&#39;m hooked on this kind of music.
Tiësto es insuperable en la época de 1997-2006 nadie va a lograr lo que el hizo, tiësto dios del trance ☝
rip :(
Tiesto was always my num 1. Why disappoint a good name and change to EDM pop crap! Rip
my favourite
muito bom ronison
The start of dj tiesto the best ever.hi start whit dj yahel in israel aylat
best version
The power of Bonzai is very big in this track.... Listen to the 1994 Bonzai samplers and you will agree with me....
Commuter train rushes without stopping....THANK YOU TIESTO..
❤👀💪💃👍✌👏❤💃
flawless! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
What happened to Tiesto? It looks like he made a big kill financially, and then went on a hide out? At least that&#39;s the impression the world has of him.
Yeah this tune takes u on a journey for sure
we need this again in 2018
Fucking tuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuune
The greatest DJ in history will never be forgotten
всем ку ку си
This is Tiesto when Tiesto was DJ Tiesto, not Sellout Tiesto
Let&#39;s celebrate him for what he once was rather than what he became!
So Good
i just listened to a new song of his...I couldn&#39;t finish it. I came back to classic Tiesto. This IS Tiesto.
This is the tune to listen to in a bmw doing 110 mile an hour face first in to a hgv <br><br>Bucket list
Classic shit right here!!...........LOUDER!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=9m13s">9:13</a> brilliant synth riff! Is this from a JP-8000 ?
pero no es q regrese tiesto fue q aparecieron más Dj unos más buenos q el y hicieron q el desapareciera o q su música no fuera ya tan buena
pues si en la época dorada de Tiesto
The Tiesto we knew and loved effectively died a decade ago.
Spoko kawałek
tiesto es el mejor de todo los tiempos 💃💃💃💃💃
Fucking great
wow
Proper tiesto
Top top tune
Best song to drive right into a front of a truck in a mini if you want to die
That beat is sick....no I&#39;m sorry, that beat is making me sick 👎👎
This is a timeless classic back when tiesto was top boy, seeing him and pvd as residents at cream ibiza at amnesia it was so good.
Tiesto to has left the building...
Gönüllerin efendisi
Chuff chuff ✌️
Well people lets get a quick vote best song <br><br>Tiesto suburban train<br> Or<br>Any shite from the last 15 years that you want <br><br><br>I know the tune i would vote for

Estos eran temass, Incomparables..... La vieja escuela de Tiesto!!!
Wonderful :)
tiesto why did you change the style that we all loved and made you what you were!!! the edm stuff sucks!! come back to trance.....we&#39;ll wait for you!!
One of the classics
beauiful
&lt;3 Epic Track shame how tiesto is now :(
er, thanks, suggested video algorithm but I don&#39;t want to watch a load of videos about trains now!
Damn tiesto we miss you.
Who cares what tiesto plays now ..he will always be a legend for me for the trance he gave us
The Sean Tyas remix of this cranks
The first 40 seconds always sounds like my computer is crashing, but after that it&#39;s a timeless classic:D
I got to see him bang this out in Chicago at Vision in 2002. Incredible set. So glad I got to see him before he turned to shit.
tune
Best piece of music ever.
2018 😎
he can&#39;t make anymore brilliant music like this because he dont take anymore drugs. a host of a show asked an Irish singer why don&#39;t you have anymore best selling albums what happened? he told him I simply stopped taking drugs, and settle down with my family while I still can. Tiesto just wanted to settle down with his family.
Amazing song. I&#39;ve gotten so much shit done listening to this
what happen to him that poxy edm shite his playing :(
I had ride my bike between Nijmegen to Arnhem on the last spring. When anybody arrives to Arnhem, s/he can see on the left, down from the bridge the Gelredome Arnhem. Place of happening 2003&#39; Tiesto: In concert.<br>I had just seen the traffic plate, and I remembered immediately!
Tiesto&#39;s best track. My favourite in trance.
Væ, ka bra!
thats a real Tiesto not that crap he plays now with Martin Garrix, shame
I LOVE TRAINS
ME, TRAIN TO NYC FROM ULTRA CONSERVATIVE DEAD EASTERN,NC
“I’d just like to apologise to the people that came out. I’m truly sorry that I wasn’t able to spoon feed you the aural urine that you’re used to,” confessed Tiësto. “I stopped playing trance some years ago when I realised people were willing to pay me more if I just played popular EDM, but I must have mislabeled a track or something and when I thought I was playing a generic join the dots EDM record I actually played good old school trance music and for that I’m sorry, it won’t happen again.”<br><br>It is believed that, immediately after the show, Tiësto set about destroying his music collection in case he mistakenly plays anything good ever again “just to be on the safe side”.
it is a real pity Tiesto gave up making such a good music like this one for the commercial crap he produces now.
2018?
Trance at its best ❤️
have a beautiful day.
classic music
When I listened to Tiesto. Kids never know.
My aunt made an ipod nano and it had this song and all of the other magikal journey songs
The greatest trance record ever made in my opinion
Childhood.
good trance music is all i need to heal my mind and body of the daily battles
this is from the time tiesto used to play real trance music
T i Ë ś Tø
shivers..
Now Tiesto is in only memory of fans. Today Tiesto is is is 😐. I thing Surban Train is create Dj is Today . Bad choise Tiesto when you lefth Trance. Trance was your family. Not this stile of today.
last song on one of the old godskitchen albums ... damn ...
Everyone should look up &quot;Kid Vicious - Re-Form&quot; now! Tiësto completely ripped that one off, lol!<br>Maybe he was never into the music at all. From what i&#39;ve heard Tiësto had &quot;his&quot; Trance tracks ghost produced. It is also obvious that Ferry Corsten was Gouryella, not Tiësto.
Top Notch!
Ta muzak jest kul
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=0m14s">0:14</a> where do I find more tracks like that ..<br>Is there a separate genre I hate &quot;EDM&quot; <br>I want club bangers like this
16 years ago...
Trance Tiesto = The Fast And Furious, Tiesto&#39;s Dub Step = 2Fast 2Furious and beyond.
what a masterpiece
Throwback when tiesto used the best producer ever
Tiësto at his absolute best. Don&#39;t even know why he had to sell out to shitty EDM. He still made a fortune from his dj sets alone back then. Sad times when a musician compromises their work for $$$ when they were so good at what they did.
2 word........... PURE CLASS
long live Tiesto !
Fuckin doped. Good Old Tiesto
oooooh that pad ♥♥♥♫♪♫♪♫♪
All time fav trance track
Epic, Genius, Masterpiece, Magnum Opus.... All comments on this page attributed to Tiesto. So many fools whining for the &#39;old Tiesto&#39; and wish he would make Trance music again. Please.... Tiesto had little, and on occasions, zero input in to the production of his tracks. Gert Huinick was responsible for much of his early tracks and Ronald van Gelderen is responsible for Suburban Train. Then of course there is Dennis Waakop Reijers, who is responsible for countless Tiesto productions and who knows how many others have contributed and gone uncredited. People need to wake up and realise the lies this man has built his career on! Not only is it built on lies he is also a cunt of a person, slating true Trance Djs and mocking the fans who made him a superstar. Quite frankly you should be glad the Trance scene is rid of him, and heap praise to the individuals who actually deserve it.
WELL YEAH BRO!
I never knew that but thanks for opening my eyes and now I can do my own research.
@stumpynadge no, ISOS 1 is legendary, but the rest sucks indeed
I agree, that he became a cunt of a person, he actually was very shy back in the days and was a genius dj and co-produced his tracks and several projects together with other trance producers... Vimana, Gouryella, Kamaya Painters and countless others... Tiesto was, and still is a true dj, and not a producer. He admitted that when he blew up in 1998/1999 His early 'solo' tunes we're co-produced by Storm, Cor Fijneman, Huinink, Waakop Reijers, Ronald van Gelderen and probably a lot more uncredited ghost producers I admit that I loved the guy back in the day and had all of his mix compilations and albums since 1995, until 2006 or something. The trance sound became boring to me, as I explored other genres back than. Since Ferry came up with Gouryella in 2015, I embraced trance again!
@Bob John q
Am I the only one who thinks that some of the track selection and especially the mixing on Tiesto's early In Search of Sunrise albums absolutely sucks?
Lol he has been always a scammer..Ronald Van Geldaren aka Kid vicious produced it as reform...I have the vinyl...Tiesto just remixed and then blatantly copied it as suburban train as a new production. And for lethal industry he copied the main lead from Alex Empire's suEcide...those he never mentioned to public because then he would have to pay royalties or credit them...but he had to credit Ronald because he accused him of copying...and for Alex Empire he didn't even received a single credit...the better example would be Samuel barber's Adagio for strings which was a William orbit's rework... derivatives of derivatives..that's how the world's no 1 superstar DJ was a big scammer...money no one decent makes decent tracks for him...and he is a joker now as same as he was before meeting Dennis Wakkop Reigers..and he even mention to Mat-Zo that the trance producers and DJs are modern day loosers and called the trance lovers as fake music lovers. Atleast Armin even working with Benno de Goeij's has massive input in his productions and still puts out banger uplifting trance tracks even though he produces commercial stuff now...and yet he even shares credit as well as awards with Benno, Unlike Tiësto whose entire career is based on utter lies..Ferry,Armin,Paul Van Dyk,MIKE aka Push, Rank 1,Binary Finary,Talla 2XLC,Solarstone are the ones who stayed true to their style despite going commercial....
Finally! I was scrolling down and hoping someone has mentioned this truth! Kinda crazy that all the credit went to this one guy when this is actually public information!
+gjtheboss true story! tijs was the face of Tiesto. Sure he was and is a great DJ but that's as far as it goes with him producing his own track...meh suburban train=https://youtu.be/w_RkPGCKFMY Traffic=https://youtu.be/FdV9jTuN6zQ I could go on but you get the point. And I think it's only fair to mention Hans Willem Mallon who was dennis right hand man in tiesto production in his trance prime!
My original comment is quite clear on this, Tiesto's involvement in the production of tracks was minimal. Ronald Van Gelderen is credited with Suburban Train. Tiesto refers to his Team who create his tracks, this is a combination of both credited and ghost producers. In his early days (the classic sound trance fans love) Gert Huinick played a huge role and Waakop Reijers has been used for over a decade. Also the Gouryella project was overwhelmingly Ferry Corsten. Simply put Tiesto has rarely ever produced his own music.
GJtheBOSS So he did... nothing?
Indeed, but Tiesto had nothing to do with the production.
GJtheBOSS you cant denie that those old tracks are masterpieces
2017🚂🎼
2017 and listening
All these childish comments ffs..Tiesto will always have my respect for the pleasure he gave me with this &amp; his other Trance tracks!!!
Classic trance .
His best by a proverbial mile
Fuck the new
Forever old tiesto
Tiesto now is memory . New tiesto never kill old Tiesto. The God Of Trance.
Reali Surban Train Is The Best song Ever made Tiesto. Tiesto is the god and king of trance from this song. For mee is the best Surban Train 2001
R.I.P DJ Tiësto
Absolutely 100% miss the old tiesto he was amazing best evere !!!
Just about to take dmt
TODAY AT 47 YEAR REALI TIESTO ALIVE. AND TODAY IS THE BEST DJ.
May be one of the best even created Tiesto.

2001 The history of tiesto. One of the best year of tiesto. He win at that year the premium gold from best Dj of the planet. And in 2003 again. TIESTO YOU ARE THE KING FOREVER . 
The best dj in history of trance don&#39;t let no one tell you different
i&#39;m 43 and this track means so much to my youth and age now, timeless classic
@Christian F Castro I didn&#39;t know Americans listened to this sort of music, sorry for your loss.
Best of The Best
This is just one of <b>the best</b> songs ever created!<br>Period!
This was probably the last great tiesto song. I can slightly tolerate his newer stuff, but it&#39;s more guetta than trance. <br><br>We miss the tiesto from before 2007
Good Memoriessss :-):-):-):-)
When Tijs verwest was Dj Tiesto
When Tijs verwest was Dj Tiesto
when tiesto was asomeone :(
This 3 song is create God of trance.
And in 2003 Adagio for string😉
Lethal Industry , Surban Train , TIESTO FOREVER
2001 Best year of TIESTO
A very dear chosen family &amp; dear friend passed away recently. This was one of one of my best friend&#39;s favorite trance songs. He would get geeked out and mega blast it in our old Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, a whale of a car, driving down Sunset Blvd when we both lived in LA. Fun, treasured memories sista. Miss ya...
@Vincent Adomat I hope you rot in hell, sucker
Christian F Castro why would u tell this to us?! Did someone ask? No if i would tell u every shit from my life trust me u would get complexes
This is the music I want to hear at live sets!
Tiesto is a god, his early trance work is some of the most beautiful, well made music I&#39;ve ever listened to.
Такого Тиесто мы никогда больше не увидим
textbook trance right here
3000 likes toch
Joooo the Best from Tiesto ! ist das Hammer!
Magnum Opus. 💛
THIS SONG IS SO FUCKING GOOD. PURE TRANCE SOUND!
This sounded so awesome at the time! Still sounds great now but at the time WOW...miss that trance scene!
it is the same hookline as Delerium Silence... not very creative, but I have to admit the coolness of this track.
shite
Epic track
Proper tiesto
The first song of him that I&#39;ve heard.
Classic trance by all means. This is what got me into the Trance scene from then and beyond.
Just a truly epic track. Tiesto you didn&#39;t have to get greedy by going all commercial. Just a waste of talent playing the shite you do now. What would be a remarkable turn of events would be to quit the shit your doing now and go back to trance where you belong.
Kid Vicious - ReForm
Question: <br>About a few of your productions. As we all know, <br>you co-produced one of Tiësto’s tracks, ‘(Sub)Urban Train’. Your own <br>name wasn’t included in the full artist though, all that was done was <br>putting your name in the Credits on the sleeve. Why was this done, <br>didn’t you find it a shame that yours wasn’t included?<br><br>Ronald van Gelderen answer:<br>That was<br> part of the agreement, they just wanted it to be the new Tiesto <br>release. It would have been nice, but I just thought, let it go. The <br>whole idea behind the track originally came from one of my tracks, Kid <br>Vicious – ‘ReForm’. Tiesto called me and told me he was producing <br>something that sounded a lot like ReForm, so then we decided to finish <br>it together.
true but doesn't change the fact that this is a stonkingly great ch00n. his current efforts, well the less said the better huh.
And now the suburban trance train was replaced by shitty subways rofl.
tiesto do did didnt do Only.!
Best part <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=0m00s">0:00</a>-end
Best part at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRIGWAyDzD8&amp;t=04m08s">04:08</a>!!!! Exstatic!!! Trance 4 ever❤️
This track makes me cry, so many memories... One of my all time favorites.
Боже блять и вы здесь говнари русские
Me too
I'm crying right now.
Fantomas24ARM Yeap,defintly one of the best trance music of all time!!!
i remember listening to this when i was 8 ... liked trance ever since
Listening this on a sea bench watching dockyard in the middle of the night. Perfect for the moment. Too bad that Tiesto stopped making this kind of magic.
absolutely love this track. But when i heard the live version from tiesto live with choir doing the backing vocals woooooooooowwwwwww! Blew me away like nothing i had ever heard!
Adam Drew I wish I could have heard that. Must have been amazing.
I will tell you a secret but this track was written by Ronald van Gelderen.
Written yes, produced no. As many people seem to get that confused.
Yes is no secret, Tiesto was not really a "producer" like Armin or Ferry for Example. Tiesto always has been a pure DJ, that is why his livesets were so perfectly mixed .
yea not many people know this :(
When people finally realized that, when you do not use analog sound or old instruments you never create such song like this.
man when that super saw comes in, holy fuck. It&#39;s like a release of all of the tension that the song built up prior to
Preston Lancashire pal
absolutely amazing soon as the song starts you hit a high of positive energy
SOULEXTASSY
Awesome track. People seem to forget or don&#39;t even know that Suburban Train is heavily based on Ronald Van Gelderen&#39;s track (Kid Vicious : Re-Form) and he should be credited also, not just Tiesto...
+WHATALOADOFTOTALBOLL want another one how about "Traffic"=https://youtu.be/FdV9jTuN6zQ
what you are saying is true but that doesn't make this track less of a masterpiece that it is
I never knew that. I cant believe I have never heard that tune. Just loaded it up and it is truly awesome. Its almost as if Tiesto just did a remix of ReForm and called it Urban Train. Although Urban Train is awesome. JFK played it at Passion classics in Coalville on 7th Jan just gone and it brought the house down as it always does.
I remember my dad listening to this that&#39;s probaly why I love this music so much too bad tiesto became a piece of garbage sellout moneymaking machine followed by brainless idiots who don&#39;t care about music at all RIP dj tiesto
verdad
preach brotha!! it's a shame.Silence, Just Be, Flight 643, etc.
f**k the new tiesto....
hermoso track
ABSOLUTE
wow..<br>when i&#39;m in bad mood,just hear this track and i feel like nothing is impossible,and positive energy rises.<br>That is Trance &#39;90-2008. <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23f">#f</a>*$ing EDM -.-
Abso-fucking-lutely....it just reminds me of the amazing, limitless potential that we, as humans have. We should never forget just how high we can raise our frequencies. This track reminds us of the glorious, panoramic, technicoloured big picture, when we find ourselves seemngly lost in the mundane, day-to-day minutiae.
I get high off trance
Adam Drew 😁
Zrinko Radeljic - amen to that!
MIODZIO !!!!
the best song for listening when i drive my motorcycle
tek rakibim THY :)

what hapened to trance i miisssssss thissss
@Adassada O jest iny ale 80% na gowno. Grenadier 22 dobre povedal.
evet olabilir
hey maşşalla
2006-2008 was when i personally noticed the decline all those 2006/2008 remixes of classic tracks most of which were either basically remasters or just pale efforts compared to the old remixes.
and no worries.
@Grenadier 311 Forgiven and forgotten Ameribro.
When placed in that context I agree, Mr. G. Chill pill taken. I've enjoyed a few excellent long-standing transatlantic relationships the past 15 years and we grill each other with good-natured stereotype based insults with no purpose but to liven things up a bit in concert with human nature. You appear to be sincere, so I beg your pardon.
@Grenadier 311 Your reading too much into it. It's no different than calling a french person a frog or an englishman a limey. Take a chill pill ffs.
It sounds more like an outright insult to most readers and at best a term of endearment condescending to any American retaining an ounce of self-worth, unless you're accustomed to dealing with partially or fully cucked, self-loathing generation-millennial creatures comfortable with self deprecation.
Elvedin Sisi edm happened
Jak to mówią u nas gówno do dupy się nie wróci a tak na poważnie czasy się zmieniają i ludzie też . Dzisiejszy trance jest inny .
Where are you from so I can effectively disparage your locale?
Elvedin Sisi ..the kids music now a days is more popular . kids listen to music associated with gun and drug crime
Only Amerifats call it EDM ffs.
1996-99/00 = Golden Age - 2008-2009/10 = Renaissance down to the dark ages post 2010 of repetitive stagnation and utterly unoriginal nonsense with divine exceptions.
they call it EDM these days :(
yeah brooo,miss too....
one of the greatest, love this track.......
Classic...this song tells a story
Each Real trance track does
I agree. I just feels like a journey m
What history?
Grew up listening to stuff like this in my teens, got me hooked on trance/electronic music in general. I&#39;m afraid times have changed and so has the music. Classic trance will never die &lt;3
Me born 2000
So true!
I can relate to this
John 00 Fleming played this last Saturday, was amazing
christopher Lawrence and John O'callaghan and his other aliases are still doing a fine job in the trance scene!
Lee Corkill I got into trance when I first heard Tiesto back in highschool. I was the first one out of my circle of friends to get into dance music and now Edm. They soon followed when we get a bit older and started going to raves. Good memories bro!
YEAH MANNNNNNNNNN
ürkütücü
nnnnnnnnnnam haey
bu adam zirvelerin kırali
great tune classic from Tiesto.
when u sing for God its is called prayer, and when God reply back its is called trance
@FearlessBOB That's a very stupid statement he just made. By the way, You are surprised as He don't exist. 🤔 There isn't a single Created thing on this Planet Earth behind which there isn't a Designer/Fashioner. A satellite ? rocket ? an aeroplane ? an engine ? a computer ? a software ? a video game ? calculator ? a watch ? a table ? a book ? a ball ? a needle ? a safety pin ? etc. etc. Imagine in a Planet with about 40,000 kilometer Circumference there isn't a single created thing without a Designer. The Universe is supposedly 13.5 Billion Light Years Big. And, 1 Light Year = Distance Travelled by Light in 1 Year. Speed of Light = 3,00,000 Kilometres per second approximately. Distance covered by Light in 1 minute would be, 60 (seconds) × 3,00,000 km. = Distance covered by Light in 1 Hour would be, 60 (sec.) × 60 (minutes) × 3,00,000 = Distance covered by Light in 1 Day would be, 60 (sec.) × 60 (minutes) × 24 (Hours) × 3,00,000 = 25,920,000,000 km. 13.5 Billion Light Years Big means Light should Travel this much Years (13.5 Billion Years). And, Light would travel 25,920,000,000 kms. in 1 Day. Distance Travelled in 1 Year would be, 25,920,000,000 × 365 = For 13.5 Billion Years Calculation, 25,920,000,000 × 365 × 13.5 billion Or 25,920,000,000 × 365 × 1,350,000,000,000 = 12,772,080,000,000,000,000,000,000 kms.
Correct!
@Grenadier 22 You make it sound like 'god' really exist....? Here is a wake up call... Prove 'god' exist. I look forward to your reply.
unless we reduce God to some level of our own human understanding far below His.
THE TRUTH....................
Sameer Bhattacharya 😱😱😱😱
Absolutely CRAP,
Thanks I am from the 1960's I used listen to music but so different back then good talking to you my friend I live in the Northwest of England in a city called Liverpool.
I suggest further expanding your view so you don't come across as someone trying to piss people off haha
@***** Don't be sorry, lad. I respect your opinion and i can understand how it's not your type of music. It's just many people considered this kind of music (trance) to be gold back in the mid 90s-mid 00's (and so do i). Trust me, this sort of music has changed nowadays. The electronic music of today definatly has the same music beat. Thanks for reading. :-)
@Hutchings the music same beet. Perhaps it's not my kind music or my generation. Didn't mean my comment to sound like it did sorry about that!
+TONY McKenna How it is crap?
Surban Train since 2001, one of the best year of Tiesto when producer trance. Yeh Tiesto was Tiesto. Never be a real Tiesto. Now Tiesto his stil its for kid. At 46 years Tiesto his Mix for a kid. F...k tech house.
Sendhere1979 We have live that moment 1998-2003. Best year of trance. But tiesto îs the the best
El major del Mundo el grande Tiestoooooo
My favorite Artist and Dj Tiesto
Tiesto for me forever best Dj of trance.
Trully the most complex trance track ever created... Different elements melted down in a pure genious way, you just crave to the apex by appreciating each second distinguished from the following. <br>Tiesto 1997-2008. R.I.P.
Try looking at Tiësto as a brand rather than a person with Tijs Verwest as the DJ and face fronting it. Ronald Van Gelderen, Cor Fijneman, Denis Waakop Reijers, Geert Huinink, Alco Lammers are the main names and talent behind many of those great Tiesto tracks and remixes you know. As for Suburban/Urban Train...well I guess Ronald Van Gelderen IS Tiësto here, and will have received payment in the same way any ghost producer should (as well as being credited).
@Hard Knight kid vicious actually did this version under the name of tiesto. same guy who did the original but did it better!
It's a blatant ripoff track...tiesto's track were always derivatives of others work...look up ReForm by Kid vicious,SuEcide which is lethal industry main lead,and the most famous Samuel's Adagio for strings...
Peter Tiesto nah not the most complex, one of but not *the* most complex. Mirco De Govia Epic Monolith takes that, there's so many levels and melodies within that one tune that compose the whole song it's unreal
last album-the magical journey_the hits collection_1998-2008
I am 35 old now, and i have only 17 when Tiesto îs the real trance Dj. I want back memori 1998-2003 best year of Tiesto. 5 yers of gold Dj.
hi
I think this moment wasn`t best becose of Tiesto. This moment was best because of you
i am 32 but Suburban Train IS THE BEST TIESTO TRACK>>>> FUCK I AM OLD:D:D:D:D:
Im 34 and ur 100% right bangers
@TrAnCe FoReVeR LeOn Tiesto didn't even produce this track.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusbYxhFBe8 (read comments - some history for you)
Hell I was born in '98, but damn does it make me wish i was alive during the peak of this era of trance
I’m 38- saw him do a live set in 01 in Amsterdam. Top night of my life
Same boat as you my friend
TrAnCe FoReVeR xxxxxx
I'm gay I agree too
Golden age should come back
I'm 37 I agree to
I hear you bro. Currently reminiscing back to when I was 16 in 2000, good times, also Gouryella.
Almost 55 end this year and still loving this. Zo when i have the oppertuninty to listen this kind of musici then thursday evening with the ASOT RADIO show of Armin van Buiten otherwise the YouTube clips with trance
you guys so yong, i 45 but My heart just born
CellPhoneAddicted I remember in 1999 first time see live tiesto in inercity concert. Dam i miss that tiesto. Surban train 2001 Adagio for straing 2003 and Lethal industry 2001. This 3 song created legend from Tiesto. Today tiesto is ...... 😞. I thing best year of tiesto was 2001. In 2001 Tieato was the best Dj of Planet at music Awards. Only Dj Tiesto was the best Dj of Planet . Today is ... 😞
i am 36. i agree 100% with you my friend! Real DJ Tiesto was 15 years ago!!!
Gutierex Tiesto îs forever Tiesto. Tiesto&lt;&gt;Trance forever. Surban Train gold Song, one of the best produce by Tiesto of all the Time.
Haha 😂 so many people here asking Tiësto to come back as he could not make good music now. But obviously the other genres of music he is playing now can&#39;t be compared with his these types of Epic Melodies. 😌 Once I referred to him on Social networking Instagram that come back to Trance please where he was advertising his some track of other genre. He blocked me, seriously! 😅 I think all his fans of Dj Tiesto should request him to make some time of his leisure to produce Trance like this. 😁
Geert Huinink & Alco Lammers produced a few tracks for him but I'm pretty sure dennis Waakop Reijers and Hans willem mallon did the majority of his producing mastering from 98-03 which was his prime IMO.
He couldn't go back to productions like this, if he wanted to. The 2 producers he had behind him at that era Geert Huinink & Alco Lammers don't  associate with him anymore. I Must say this was "His" best sound
Lol he blocked me on facebook too when I posted a meme about him being happier when he did trance.
I was with Tiesto in the same train last night
Who gives a flying fuck?
geniaaal..!
geniaaal..!
Потрясающая классика! столько воспоминаний
The absolute pure and real trance. I miss songs like this.
morefromnomore 😢
morefromnomore Never came back this music . Its just only in memory. This Tiesto is dead. Trance is dead
I think this is Tiësto&#39;s best track because he takes you on a journey and that&#39;s how trance should be.
Exactly
@Supernatural Forces ²4³
nyana my favourite
THE BEST TIESTO TRACK
This is called progressive trance. You should check out The Blizzard, Kalopsia is a masterpiece.
Flight 643 😚😚😚🥰
Nyana will always be number one
I agree
@Supernatural Forces ferrys mix of adagio for strings beats tiestos hands down.
@Kirsty Morton Ronald van Gelderen is also co-writer
Ron van den Beuken
Flight 643 is even better cause he takes you on a flight
@TranceElevation awesome tune man, used to rinse this out every set back in the day.
@Tom Simeone 100% agree with you mate.
@Supernatural Forces adagio is a cheese fest. Should be locked up for what the dutch cheese mongers did to that amazing piece by Samuel Barber. Blasphemous
Another track that takes you on a journey is Walking On Clouds. Such a masterpiece
i agree, no one should be waiting on a trains. trains is about the journey
This is one of a handful of things that Tiesto has done that I like.
Ronald Van Gelderen made most of this and Dennis Waakop Reijers did the rest.
Arguably one of DJ Tiësto's tracks
perfectly said
Literally his best track. This is a masterpiece
Arch enemy
Everyone's right really All these tracks make sets. Sets are where the full journey takes place. It's just when the likes of these come on, you stop, turn your head to the side, smile at your mates or random next to you and then continue with the march
Adagio for strings is just a remix of someone else’s work. Suburban train is far better!
@Bert Bertinson You're right, it is a dead genre save for a few tracks here & there. I get my kicks out of techno these days ..
Jan Johnston - Flesh (Tiesto Remix) man
agreed!! I heard it first in spring 2002!! epic indeed!!
Theme From Norefyell, Sparkles, Urban Train are his best TRANCE tracks ever, imo
Useless discussion lo, he just co-produced his own tracks... he alwas had, and still has ghost producers
💯
Listen to Goldenscan - Sunrise (Tiesto Remix)
It is a great track, as Tiesto never made it... lol. “Ronald Van Geldren did” and he is one of the finest Trance producers that’s ever been.
@Supernatural Forces i feel ya,but i have to disagree, simply because that it is not his song,maybe best remix for you,one can argue that but not his best song👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
You are a 180.000% correct,best tiesto song👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
You should listen the original https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusbYxhFBe8
This along with Obsession are my fav Tiesto tracks. And he is not the original creator of Adagio for Strings, but he did put his own sound on it. Its not his original track tho. But it is a classic, obviously
Traffic is also a good one.
It's kind of ironic because id agree with this as one of his best tracks, yet it was also the last great track before his mainstream stuff
@MW Enytime tried to listen to Psychedelic Psytrance? ;) Hehe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM_-ce4x4q8
True - the connection between trance and going on a trip is well known :p
Absolutely . . . <3
Energy 52 - Café del Mar is nice too , Or Universal Nation , or some PvD Tracks or Oakenfold ....a lot of Stuff was amazing...June from BT...
The reason it's so good compared to his other productions is that it's co-produced with Cor Fijneman. Never been a fan of tiesto's work but the ones I do like are always Co produced with someone else, moral of the story, Tiesto has never been decent
This song is a masterpiece ⚡💫💥
S. Knight try me
Yes, this is his most typical trance track. Another tracks is something else..
@6x6 Records HOLY CRAP!! You nailed it RIGHT on the head!! Does anyone else get this????
@Supernatural Forces that was shit, it was like cheese on an... ergh no nasty
PERFECTLY SAID!!!!! XOXO
How about *Ten seconds before sunrise* ?
Silence - Delerium (Tiesto remix) is my favorite but this one is in the top 5
Trance tiesto is million times better than nowadays gay house tiesto
Flight 643 is just wild techno and no melodies backing it up. It's super catchy and well sounded alone, yes, but to define quality it can't contend with Suburban Train.
neyna and suburban train in my opinion is his best. .. fuk sake what happened to him
I agree. The progression and the feelings on this track are so great... Everytime I listen it (and basically, it's at least twice a day on average), I feel the same wonderful trip in my mind. Best Trance track ever for me.
Nyana, A Tear in Open, Forever Today, Traffic, Euphoria, Lethal Industry, Flight 643, Olympic Flame and Adagio for Strings as mentioned, what about the progression there? IMO Euphoria and Flight 643 are better than Suburban Train
+andjoha but the awesomeness in Adagio from 1:36 -2:36 then from 3:46 can take u where u can't exactly describe. ☺
+Hasan Darvish I disagree. Adagio for strings is nice and stuff, but the progression in this track is out of this world!!
Hear his Adagio for strings (7:23) 😛
Cosmic gate remix &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; original mix.
gooooooooooooood sonng
Its funny how if you search &quot;Tiesto&quot; on the right hand side &gt;&gt; It&#39;s amazing.<br> Yet you GOOGLE him now and He&#39;s a joke
Try looking at Tiësto as a brand rather than a person with Tijs Verwest as the DJ and face fronting it. Ronald Van Gelderen, Cor Fijneman, Denis Waakop Reijers, Geert Huinink, Alco Lammers are the main names and talent behind many of those great Tiesto tracks and remixes you know. As for Suburban/Urban Train...well I guess Ronald Van Gelderen IS Tiësto here, and will have received payment in the same way any ghost producer should (as well as being credited).
Tiesto has never been Good. All these classic tracks are produced by other artists (ghostwriters). "Tiesto" was more of a marketing brand.
TIESTOOO the king of trance, come back to trance :(:(:(:(
Banging tune! So good. :)
A tidal wave of euphoria has just washed over me :D
‪#‎TheGreatestDJOfAllTimes‬ ‪#‎Legend‬ ‪#‎Tiesto‬ ‪#‎trance4ever‬
one of the earliest Tiesto songs that got me into Trance genre &lt;3
same here
Listenin to this really takes me back. I&#39;m really choke dhow all these new tracks and dj&#39;s all sound the same. No originality whatsoever.
Epic!
yea I here that, it reminds of, eye of the tiger or some van halen, this is great, tiesto is incorporating old with new, tiesto is by far the most talented  dance music dj on mother earth, AWSOME SAUCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This reminds me how music was born by harmonizing different sounds to form a masterpiece.This song gives me different emotion by its sound.
DJ Tiesto &gt; Tiesto<br><br>R.I.P. DJ Tiesto :(
Danndock he isn’t dead ?
Son, ask urself , What did u do for the WORLD ! ♥ to all who made themself able to recieve that , those who not , we pray .
RIP DJ TIESTO 🤧😭🙏😭🤧 1 like = 1 prayer

Manuel Peru he doesn’t (and never has) produced anything
@Tony ozcan Ever since his music started to suck, I stop listening to him.
@Manuel Peru if you read the comments or listen to his music, everybody will say we miss the old tiesto. they got the technology to give anybody a silicone body with sumbody elses brain. :)
@Tony ozcan then who is that person producing music now.
@Manuel Peru no im being serious, i was driving to work on the radio it said that he had a car accident he had died. all of a sudden his music changed? its not him.
@Tony ozcan I wish I can believe that but I know it's sarcasm.
@Manuel Peru he died in a car accident many years ago. it was announced on the radio. his music is differnt cos its not him.
For a moment there,I thought he was like..... Dead! Don't be posting that kinda thing, some of us live in a padded cell... Our only contact with the outside world is old(and amazing) tunes via YouTube!
Yep R.I.P he will be remembered for the good he did early on in his career 🤣
His not dead he is very much alive.
He is NOT dead. Idiots....
I DON'T UNDERSTAND..
R.I.P Grandpa :(
Orion Cramer I miss the old tiesto, he used to make amazing trance music, to bad he doesn't produce trance anymore and produces EDM with that annoying drop at the end.
Lo masss$
Danndock 7 years 😎
Dimitris Karaoulas wots ya probs like ya think ya big and hard tiesto best dj going you wanna Fuck off back home
I can't deny.. so true
+Gutiierrex x He refers to the old tiesto vs the new one. Obviously the old is better he no longer register his songs as DJ Tiësto, just like Tiësto
Is not necesary, Tiesto can be named Tiesto or DJ Tiesto, its same.
This is how Tiesto became famous .. tracks likes these were all over the place in holland. and this was mainstream in the 2000\&#39;s i heard it all over the radio<br>TMF/MTV were amazing back than... most tracks were good.. <br>today its all ruined for many years allready.
@The Banff Local sure there are. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusbYxhFBe8 (read the comments - some history for you). Sound familiar? I was always amazed that no one else seemed to pick up on this back when this first came out. Even the "tiesto remix" was produced by someone else.
No there weren’t lol. There are no other tracks like this one.
Yoo I make old trance
AVLRECORDS huge good luck to you 👍👍👍☺️☺️☺️
an epic, immortal track
+Ta Jasne Indeed..in my mind I have a soundtrack for my last day in this world/life and this is one of the tracks.
I remember going to see Tiesto many many years ago. It&#39;s almost embarrassing that I liked the guy. What a sellout, but this track is beautiful.
@bpm KARAOULAS sit down. You were probably wearing pull up nappies 20+ years ago
Tiesto had Ghost writers back in the Days. He has never written any classic himself
Najlepszy czas Tiesto... :) Amazing.
God this is so good! How the hell did a genius like Tiesto go from beautiful trance to utter rubbish in the space of a decade? It&#39;s like the Angel Gabriel metamorphosed into Adolf Hitler. 
@Craig Rex Armin definitely....
It's like hoovering up a gram of coke...you just don't know when to stop and then it becomes shiit.
tambien me pregunto que le pasó a tiesto
All about the money, trance became less popular, he moved with the times. Shame that he sold out but can’t deny these old tunes he made were pure 🔥
Hello Hero , what are ur live learnings and what u spread in pooptube is not mine favorite to read in a bad morning for the --------09800779time, here it comes , WHAT IS UR CONTEXT AND WHERE.
Try looking at Tiësto as a brand rather than a person with Tijs Verwest as the DJ and face fronting it. Ronald Van Gelderen, Cor Fijneman, Denis Waakop Reijers, Geert Huinink, Alco Lammers are the main names and talent behind many of those great Tiesto tracks and remixes you know. As for Suburban/Urban Train...well I guess Ronald Van Gelderen IS Tiësto here, and will have received payment in the same way any ghost producer should (as well as being credited).
He has probably fucked up his brain with drugs
Lmao he was never a genius it was all ghost produced
So true my brother!
He got a new ghost producer in. That's all. Tijs didn't write this.
Because the mind was saturated with effort and activities, and the connection to the true source of creativity was severed. It is a spiritual, energetic connection to the source of creativity, and it can be lost.
well he didnt actually produce any of this tracks to start with
Money.
PrimeM92 bit strong...... And stupid
HA HA HA
+helawolf True story. In fact tijs got his start under the alias da joker spining hard house. And do ya'll like the song "Traffic", the samples came from a "techno" dj from Detroit Sean Deason- Psykofuk.https://youtu.be/FdV9jTuN6zQ
awesome so right/ money talks...always
PrimeM92 you talking cod shit tune is banging
Kyon: Go further back and Detriot made Techno, and Chicago made House. Europe was more friendly to this type of music and why most artists hail from European countries than good old USA. Do note, most rhythms trace back to Africa. Be less a bigot.
+chillegast: When the music market shifted in the mid-2000s is when this type of music dried up. For shame really! Lucky to be among early Gen Y'ers that actually remembers electronic music hitting the airwaves of USA. One of the rock stations played trance hour at night. I wish I had access to the internet to look up what was playing on their website back then if DSL was not a thing and late-2000s tech came much earlier.
When USA created edm..
Word
Sorry to Disagree with you Craig but you are 50%wrong..Armin did yes but PvD has always been true to Trance!!!
Life
:DD and because $$$ But well, Lucifer was an angel too...
It's just greed to much money
PrimeM92 Cos money
GaaraSama1983 You can still bang out cracking tunes while been mainstream on the side.
He probably switched ghost producer
tiesto decided to go big and poison american kids with a tasteless crossover from pop, house supported by popular hip hop artist. since then thousands of , mostly, us kids jumped on board on the so called EDM scene, they dont care about music, they come to see the clowns (guetta, SHM, tiesto.....)
how ?? .. money, money ! !!!!! ;)).. he got greedy ..  still can't argue he had some serious talent, this IS a sublime track ... and he did a handful of other great tracks , before he sold his soul .. )))
I'm glad this was encompassed in such a small time period. Such magical times it makes me sad to think back. Those times can't last forever. I'm glad he continued to be successful afterwards, rubbish or not.
well said my friend
+PrimeM92 I couldn't agree more! Tiesto, Sander van Doorn, Orjan Nilsen... utter dogshite now
+PrimeM92 He was supposed to have a mandatory celestial "soul-mate" ceremony with DJ jon alonso but instead chose to rebel as usual. I think the forces of nature and rebelling against him lol. He refuses to harmonize with his pre ordained destiny and JAA is suffering because of it, causing widespread suffering and confusion. Please help bridge this gap at any cost. We all can feel this pain as a shared existence and we need it to be corrected and healed. Much appreciated!! <3DJJAA
+PrimeM92 Couldnt agree more... Same with Paul Van Dyk and Armin Van Burren.... all jumped on the EDM train to shitville
😂👍
100% agree!!!
+PrimeM92 Most artists have a peak for a specific time (some longer some shorter) and then they completely disappear or go mainstream. Still don't blame him, I'm thankful for Tiesto's music and if he wants to make just money now, then it's his right to do so.
@Kenny D Haha you're funny :p
+Ella Shy that's were rocky went wrong in rocky 3.
+PrimeM92 Agreed, Tiesto used to be amazing, now its just elevator, middle of the road bullshit
@or yashar Δ﻿ then the moral of the story is stay hungry xD
@PrimeM92 he needs to eat and pay the bills, hes an angel in disguisse now
@PrimeM92 Lol!!! that's the funniest shit ive heard all month!!! totally agree!!
I&#39;d take this out for a run in Our National park .
kelebek misali uşar arı misali konar
tepeden bakan tekkişi budur işte
Trance classic never die
People the life hes change, the music hes change, tiesto has change, i hope tiesto come back to trance.
&lt;3
back when Tiesto produced awesome music...
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh. :)
Yeah! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ClassicOfTheDay">#ClassicOfTheDay</a>. Love it!!!
2.40, 3.40 &amp; 4.27 for an angel?. Oh dear Tiesto!
@Ricky M He is talking about a track by Paul Van Dyk: For an Angell, check it out, it is legendary. But this track is not copied by it
@Simbo 321 what are you even talking about.
cool track
OMG memories of some epic Tiesto gigs!!
Trance forever <br>
It has a bit of Sean Callery&#39;s 24 theme. I like it.
the shame is that all the new house tiesto supporters do not really know that what made tiesto so famous were trance songs like this. This is the real tiesto
rafa montejo dude Tiesto's 'house' is shitty EDM. He's a joke these days
Well before tiesto was doing trance tiesto was doing dutch hardcore/gabber
Exactly, most stuff doesn't even have any groove, something that also defines house.
+rafa montejo not even house. pop music
@rafa montejo​ except what he's making isn't House. Period. ﻿Saying Tiësto is a House producer is like saying Justin Bieber is a Heavy Metal singer. House music is characterised by strong Funk, Disco and Soul influences, Tiësto's new releases do not have that.
@Laura L calm down please. Tiësto has been producing house the last 5 years. Pure or not, it is house. And all I was saying is that it's a shame that nowadays' fans of Tiësto don't know his real genre was trance. So calm down. It was an opinion, not a dick, don't take it so hard :)
@Gosha Rubchinskiy Interesting, Thanks for the info! I've heard Klause Schulze too.
@Laura L Trance has its roots in 70s also with klause schulze, morphed into electronic music as proto goa, and then went mainstream at the beaches in 1992-6.
@rafa montejo lol. Tiesto isn't ''House''. Especially these days with his POP MUSIC persona. Why are there so many trolls around the media calling him ''house''. wtf?? Frankie Knuckles, the Godfather of House music circa 1977 {RIP} would hang his head in shame. Please learn the history of Dance music. House came before Trance. House was basically a rejuvenated version of Disco music. Trance was born in the 1990s, House was born in the late 1970s in Chicago, The Warehouse. Educate yourself before you mislabel artists and music.
I want Tiësto back!!! :(
Me too Hugo
Not you again Patrick
@Hugo Hakvoort I want DJ Tiësto back
@Marie-Laure Nannan Haha I know, it fits him a lot better, I don't even think he enjoys the music he does now as much as his trance.
EDM and EHM are a load of dung I am a 14yr old and I hate EDM my dad and me love the old trance classics. music from before I was even born and it sounds better than anything we hear these days on the radio David Quetta and Calvin Harris are rubbish in my eyes tiësto armin van buren sasha chicane the thrill seekers and PPK were what made electro music stand out and this song is unreal good work tiësto :) :)
Boy you must be 17 by this date, I wonder if you still have the same thoughts
trance trance trance hijaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Classics is where it is man nalin and Kane all the way
Matthew Crooks that's pretty damn awesome to share this with your pops. we need more people like you to educate this generation on what trance really is, and really sounds like.
The scene was basically dead before you were born. that sucks.
I'm glad your dad instilled some classics into you. Your dad has impeccable taste
@Matthew Crooks that's a good boy
@Matthew Crooks Trance falls under Electronic Dance Music...or EHM, whatever floats your boat but in all seriousness EDM is an umbrella term and trance is not independent from it. But regardless, PLUR bratan.
Same thing for me Matthew! This is some real trance!
+Ricky M think it closed shortly after 
@Matthew Crooks Yes that's what it was named after Paradise lost, then went downhill lol
+Ricky M the elephant room ??
@Matthew Crooks I used to go out clubbing in Belfast 1998 onwards, Ask him did he ever go to Paradise lost on Friday nights :)
+Ricky M back in the good old days of trance dance music and places like Kelly's (portrush) and Ibiza where popular for good music. And you two probably are the same age :)
@Matthew Crooks a Lad with Sense, your dad is probably about my age and i still love the trance classics.
when tiesto had my respect
I still have respect for him. What he represents now doesn't take away from what he accomplished. His modern stuff is not my cup of tea but as long as millions of people enjoy it then it's all good in my book. Also Andy N makes a good point. There always have been more people behind the Tiesto project, not even actual secret ghost producers, it has always been publicly known. The big thing is that he's not the producer part, he's the DJ part.
To help clarify what Andy N was saying - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusbYxhFBe8
No one gives a fuck about your respect. Guy moved on. This song is still fucking great.
Try looking at Tiësto as a brand rather than a person with Tijs Verwest as the DJ and face fronting it. Ronald Van Gelderen, Cor Fijneman, Denis Waakop Reijers, Geert Huinink, Alco Lammers are the main names and talent behind many of those great Tiesto tracks and remixes you know.

Indeed😔
Uf, TDSOTM
not just your respect..
Leesus phinx you like The good music. Pink Floyd and Tiesto.
The best there&#39;s the there was and the best there ever will be 
Come back to trance tiesto!! 
even if he left trance he was the one that make trance a part of my life!
He never wrote any of his ons songs. He has Ghost writers. Ronald van Gelderen wrote and produced this track. Listen to: Kid Vicious- "Re-form"
good song
Class tune. Simple as!!
Timeless classic 
Sounds like someone copied Martin garrix... 
He was wearing nappies when Tiesto was producing this sort of stuff
LOL that's the funniest comment I've read all day.
@Chris Green well, probably it's the other way around si, seguramente fue justo al revés
I'm sorry but that is one of the stupid things I've read.
@Jilani Quadri no, not a troll, just a dumbass
loool haha omg 
All those people who take it far too serious -.-
HA HA so stupid! 
I understand that makes them angry, but clearly it is sarcasm (I hope)
obvious troll is obvious 
Martin Garrix- pissing in panties when tiesto already played this songs heheheheh STUPID CHILD  END OF WORLD- TIESTO COPIED MARTIN GARRIX
At the day this song was released, Martin Garrix probably even didn't know what DJ was!
reminds me of Trans-Europe Express
Tiesto&#39;s masterpiece
Hate to say it but this and a lot of his tracks were ghost produced. Still a masterpiece though! http://denniswr.com/tracks/
This
Those synths at the beginning sound so big and warm, I bet they&#39;re analogs. 
Wow! Sounds great :D
To me this is the biggest/best trance track ever!
This track is so good, so good memories back in time :)
Nice. Easily recognized the unit as a CP AC4400. Because the number was blocked off, don&#39;t know which CP unit.
som muito bom otima montagem  show 
Wooooo Tiesto live ! 
I Miss This Tiesto :/
Maan :(<br><br>Brings back lots of memories. Thank you for it.
tiesto please go back to trance....tis what made you no 1!!!
golden songs
This is Tiesto&#39;s Magnum Opus
HW Mallon played a bigger role than DJ Dennis Waakop. HW Mallon was basically DJ Dennis' friend and assistant, and apprentice. HW Mallon showed DJ Dennis the ropes back then. Together they made legendary tracks with Tiesto.
Magnum Opus...from Mad Max!
This is a remake of kid vicious aka Ronald Van Gelderen "re-form" https://youtu.be/Twy3MOOXsE8 and Dennis Waakop Reijers did most of Tiesto production in his trance prime with some help from Hans Willem Mallon
Bob John Dennis and Hans? Sorry have I missed something?
Yes a magnificent octopus
so much better than the original! dennis and hans at their finest
yeeeas
This is pinnacle Tiesto.
+Sérgio Martins well, not checking a dictionary and from my understanding only, a magnum opus is like the most outstanding work by an artist or person, the one which represents the peak of his excellence and artistry (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong! : ) ) I just discovered this song, and well...it's very difficult to disagree with OP :D
Thermometer10 sorry I'm late, but whats that?
18 ppl dnt no shit wat a classic 
old tiësto is best tiësto
@Andy N brilliant. Tiesto is a ghost producer
old tiësto is not tiësto. Or I should say not Tjis...
Its not Tiesto, its written by Ronald van Gelderen.
The best sound of extacy.
Mindig is egy alapkő lesz.  Ty Tiesto !!
Classic Prog Trance!
This is how it should be. Not that horrible shit what we&#39;ve got nowadays when every song must contain stupid vocals and all that kind of shit.
I remember listening to lots of crap music around 2000. It was as bad as it is today.
Vocal and a drop lmao
trance...they don&#39;t make it like they used to... /sigh
14 человек против хорошей музыки.
Tiesto&#39;s Trance is elementary of my life
What has Tiesto turned into now? :(

Bad House. :(
+Kidawesome Kraft 😆👍💁🏿
RIP Tiesto, Trance has missed you
i only recently discovered this song and i love this beautiful insane stuff to death, but for the first minute and a half of the song, doesn&#39;t it <b>SEEM</b> as if the synth and kick are not in sync? or was that just my faulty perception?? :/ cuz i swore the thing was not for the least 100% synchronized!! please tell me i&#39;m right.. 
I guess what you're hearing is "MIDI clog", it just can't handle many note commands on the exact same moment. Those were the days :)
That's one part that makes this song so unique
think of it as an "audio illusion" it is very purposefully done as drumm909 mentioned ( love the 909 analog :P) 
Things are shuffled around, it's what gives this tune its swing and urgency!
it seems like it, i also noticed it, but it is everywhere like this, in every mix i've listened to. and if you wait for the "hats and the bass" you'll see it will get in perfect sync :) i guess he liked it like that :P
Yeah, but Tiesto can make it sound legit at the same time lol
Yup i noticed the same.
Haha you troll.
Ronald van Gelderen?
If you like the harder version of this one, check out: Tiesto - Urban Train (cosmic gate remix) :) Both are really really great
The trance of the century.
shiverrr
so true my man..ppl nowadays wants just big fat bass...they forgot about the melody!

WTF Chevy truck commercial? Needs to be an ecstasy awareness commercial
Do you ride the Suburban Train with an OV-Chipcard? Don&#39;t forget to throw it in the trash bin and out the train!
It still flies on the wings of Immortal timeless Trance! Tiesto don&#39;t stop feeling the music and sometimes don&#39;t do it for the masses cause they wanna stomp mindlessly....This is music from the heart. You can feel the emotions behind it!
The greatest trance track of all time. It&#39;s the embodiment of the genre. 
I LOVE &quot;TRAINCSE&quot;
одна из лучших композиций как в прошлом так им на сей день!спасибо TIESTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ты Великий,просто спасибо,что ты есть!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Согласен100%
ты прав!!!!!!!!!на все 10000 
This one song got me into Trance. We&#39;re now 10 odd years later and it&#39;s still as fucking incredible as the first time.
I have to be honest, I typically dislike Tiesto for his crappy electro sounds and mediocre trance productions overall. But, Suburban Train is completely different. It might as well be the best trance track from the 00&#39;s and even goes beating some trance released in the early 90&#39;s. This tracks is a massive journey. The only people who hate this probably only hate it because a lot of people hate Tiesto for being the overrated snob he currently is.
I have 26 years old, I started listening to trance in 1997. But this track changed my way of seeing the Trance, go memories, the golden age of Tiesto.
Hell yeah!
Still a great track! 
This piece gives so many ideas and themes for musicvideo.
don´t care about other peolpe, i´m sure both share the like of this song :)
This song, and Tiesto&#39;s remix of Silence have to be not only my favorite trance songs, but favorite songs of all time. They just don&#39;t come like this anymore. 
He got caught up in the bro culture. 
What happend to &#39;this&#39; Tiesto?
nothing, the problem are the new youth. They don't/want have the time/patience to listen to long songs... It must all be quick and loud.
Top 1
Who needs food for energy when u got tiesto!
Listened to this in my car today. Never gets old.
pisi pisiiiiiiiiii
golden age of trance...
one of Tiesto&#39;s best... I prefer Forever Today, but... that one is cover version, not made by Tiesto original :( Suburban Train - love this tune! ♥
believe it or not but this song gives me motherfucking energy 
mike tyson brought me here!
Top 5 Trance songs of all time
music at this moment sucks. it so sad that that the real trance stopped until something about 2006
lord have mercy 
Yes man, I completely understand your point... It&#39;s a shame how he changed... 
This is trance.
one of the only house songs I actually like.
i dont disagree about that.....but when you know that an artist like tiesto who made pieces of arts is no more making songs like this, then you are dissapointed....
Monster tunage, 1 of my fav most listened to (&quot;,)
10 years later, still gives me the shivers.
any kind of entertainments now is ruined by greed one way or another!!
music doesnt have to be dirty to be good you dumb fuck
I like House but i also like Trance there&#39;s only one way to find out which is better...FIGHT. (I miss Harry Hill)
there&#39;s no need to live in the past!!! there are plenty of trance artists nowadays and new labels who are making fantastic tunes and no one is here to listen to their great work! it&#39;s your job to find these artists and listen to what they make, then they will have a chance to get bigger!!!!
This is probably my favorite track of all time. I don&#39;t care what Tiesto did or does. This track was enough to put him into God of Trance status.
i love this mix dj tiesto the best 
just classsssss
how in the hell is that relevant?
Today&#39;s stuff I would label &quot;Handbag Trance&quot;.
De donde sacaste esta super version extendida? esta excelente!
yeah...... tiesto never died..
The sound starting at 4:07 I fucking love this sound hnnnnnnnnggggg
Chamillinionaire
Chimmilionaire
Define &quot;dirty&quot;. You can have &quot;dirty&quot; basslines, which aren&#39;t bad, or you can have dirty lyrics, and vocals suck in general, not to mention perverted ones.
GTFO, Hipster.
DAMN! Stop calling todays music HOUSE! it&#39;s nothing close to house music. House music is an UNDERGROUND genre from the early 1980s and it is still underground. All today&#39;s music literally got no style. Or no it is BULLSHIT. Once in early 90s a genre was created taking melody progression&#39;s like strings from house music and drums from techno. It was called Trance and dominated mainstream scene.What is today&#39;s mainstream? Nothing Just Trance-like sounds with crap melodies, crap drum and gay vocals 
FACT! 
Agreed 100% . I miss him :(
God I miss Tiesto :((((((((
Rihanna and Lady Gaga are good example.
I&#39;ve decided i prefer this
i like the remix but i also like this, amazing choon
Old Tiësto come back, we need you
moment of discovery i think he meant, i often have favourites then i stumble across other songs and they become favourites at the time
Released: 2001... now i can say with certainty that i will never stop listening to this song, after whole this time its still sounds great
i feel sorry for everyone bashing tiesto for his recent work. This is beyond human level
AWESOME/toon
I understand why he made the move to electro-house. It&#39;s popular right now, and he&#39;s trying to stay relevant. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m glad I did, in fact, I&#39;m furious. I detest electro-house and truly wish he would go back to his trance roots.
oh probably lmfao dirty...
&#39;LMFAO&#39; Dirty or &#39;Bass Noise&#39; Dirty?
MD-MAzing!
Ahhh Tiesto, how your sounds fucking suck these days. Sell out.
Still good Progressive Trance at its best, Tiesto moved with the times 
/watch?v=XioMTPeIiVo this is what he is talking about
nothing, he is wrong
what does armin has to with this track?! 
thank tiesto &amp; armin create this trance song ^^ i never forget it ~~ the best trance love in the universe
cool 
My all time favourite track.
Heard this track in Oliver Prime&#39;s remix on Global Trance Grooves, March 2012 ed. It&#39;s amazing that it&#39;s 11 years old - an eternity in trance time. May be the Dorian Grey of trance tracks, still lush, vibrant and timeless. 
i like trains, but I LOVE this track !
The one and only...Tiësto
One of Tiesto&#39;s best classic trance tracks. Epic. Long buildup, Long peak, invigorating.
lol! I love them both. Haters will hate.
absolutly a genuis tiesto 
R.I.P Tiesto /watch?v=FThuVI_maAs
I kinda disagree with you about his recent house productions. Yes some of them are kinda shitty but theres olso a few which are really great...And who says money makes people make house shit? For whatever reason he makes house now, well that his choice and I dont think we should be jumping to conclusions about why he makes house...And I have a feeling that sooner or later he will come back to trance
From a time when music didn&#39;t have to be &#39;dirty&#39; to be good.
I gon&#39;t get why I can&#39;t like both House and Trance :I
you can! why would you not like the both of them and mix it in a mix-ep
because he makes multiple times more money than he had, because now he&#39;s mainstream and more people listen to his house shit, and I need to stress SHIT. He might be good at producing them, but if he did the good stuff it would be too complicated for stupid mainstream fans. This track is awesome and just by being here tells me you know sth about music, so you know what I&#39;m talking about. He could have created few more masterpieces, but if money is more important, then you just make house shit
I dont understand what does tiesto switching from trance to house has to do with money? People sometimes change and lose intrest in stuff and move on to other stuff...Tiesto seems to be liking house music alot and he&#39;s good at producing them too...
Also credit to Ronald van Gelderen for his part in the composition!
this tune is true trance music in the purest form! just smashes through all the fake trance listeners. If Tiesto wrote these type of bangers these days trance would be on Top 
For me Gouryella - Tenshi is the best Tiesto track, but this one is close.
ahhhh ...i miss the old tiesto so much T_T 
it´s the best song of dj tiesto! 
So awesome... SUPER!!!!
To find it? Why?
That bass line is the cleverest thing i ever heard in any trance song...it doesnt fit at the start but then it all comes together....fantastic!
A minute is no few secs
10-27 runs the long mix I believe. Unless it&#39;s just slower
best of tiesto... only recognized by true trance fans 
I like the Album Mix better
now this tune is a one and only that should always be listened to!
This isn&#39;t loud enough!
it took me 20 minutes to find this track , but it was worth it:)
is this for sure original mix? because I know another version also referred to as original, it&#39;s almost the same but there are small details different, and it&#39;s much older post than this one... what&#39;s the trick?
agreed with everything, and also with the last line. I would never sell myself for money if I would be able to make something I love. If I was Tiesto I&#39;d make as much as possible tracks like this one
my favorite song and will always be. untouchable
I can&#39;t stress enough how much of a fan I am of trance music, and this track in general. This is one of my all time favourite tracks ever, and one that resonates to my very soul. This track is ENLIGHTENMENT, and PEACE and LOVE and BLISS. (p.s. what happened Tiesto?)
not 1 dislike , and rightly. proves this is a masterpiece =)
Best Tiesto song EVER !!! 
kick ass tune.........
Listen to it WITHOUT drugs,i bet you its sounds even better :) 
2012.. 11 years later, and still gives me pimples every single time i hear it &lt;3 sadly enough tiesto was too obsessed to change his style. period.
agreed
It&#39;s called euphoric :P
it&#39;s the #2 best sound of the world --- #1 is ELEMENTS OF LIFE &lt;3 
modern trance sounds superficial and artificial.....no heart, no depth..........now i&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t any good cause there are some decent tunes but nothing will ever compare to these
you say at the moment? His new style will never match this.
This is my favourite Tiesto Song at the moment :D
Tiesto...good from 1997 to 2004...who ever agrees copy and paste this video...u never know tiesto might change if he sees people prevred his old stuff
Thumbs up if u listenin&#39; this on 2012 !
Tiesto&#39;s best track in my opinion
TIESTO best DJ EVER!!!
@TheJhonny653 i flt simliar as a young lad.. thanks 
@hevok2009 epidome*
THIS is true trance, it has nostalgia and instant classic written all over it...this track is the epidomy and prime example of what TRUE trance should sound like........just fucking mind blowing stuff
@tudmak This is the kind of music (back in 2001) Tiesto made BEFORE selling out to fame and money...sad because this is by far the best trance track I&#39;ve heard and very few that equal or surpass this track since 2001....
one of the all time greatest tracks! massive Tiesto &lt;3 please come back from producing commercial crap
Some people say this track is cool. For me it&#39;s the best tune ever made. It sounds so simple and complex, happy and sad, calm and energetic. Whenever I hear it, it touches my heart and enlightens it with sunshine. It&#39;s fuckin brilliant! nice upload.
A classic that makes u smile! :o) Urban trains a classic too!!!
One of my fav&#39;s :) Thanks for the long mix !
